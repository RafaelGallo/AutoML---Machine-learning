**Paper**

[https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06377)

**Abstract**

 This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3x or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pre-training and shows promising scaling behavior.",1636821678.0,2021-11-13 17:41:18
[D] Algorithms for correlation of events/issues,3,qt90rt,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qt90rt/d_algorithms_for_correlation_of_eventsissues/,0,"Generally any application software co-exists with multiple other software where a problem with one software can have a cascading effect on some other software, somewhere else in the stack. E.g 

1. you deploy you application as a pod in kubernetes (orchestration software)
2. but the pod or container is not running after sometime because the ec2 machine (or any virtual machine) on which the pod was scheduled to run has some issues.
3. the ec2 machine or the vm is having some issues because the autoscaling software that is supposed to manage the vms properly is not working correctly.
4. the autoscaling software is not working correctly because of some other dependent system not doing this job.
5. basically there can be a CHAIN of issues where one issue can have a significant cascading effect on many other dependent software systems.

You can apply this logic to many other places. Imagine your application is not working properly BECAUSE your load balancer is not working properly which is BECAUSE you load balancer vms are having networking issues because you have some datacenter level failures etc. You have all the logs files spread across the stack which reports these issues independently but usually it takes manual effort to CORRELATE them to figure out what is the root cause.

typically the user sees the symptoms at a high level in the stack, e.g. application is working properly and then they will start debugging and then finally you figure out somewhere down the stack something is wrong. This usually takes specific expertise (SRE) and takes time to arrive at the root cause.

basically what is happening is here is a CHAIN of events with cascading effect. There are ways to catch this using monitoring dashboards but the problem is usually those monitoring dashboard are setup in a static way, manually setup and typically has a maintenance problems long term. i.e. if there is a change in one of the software version which wants you to change a the dashboard accordingly, then you might forget to modify the monitoring dashboard accordingly etc. Also setting up these monitoring dashboards are very specific to the problem, this means you need to setup various different kinds of dashboards for different systems & scenarios.

We want to apply AI to this problem if possible. We want to come up with a well trained AI based system which can tell you which is the actual root cause issue if you give it 10 different issues that happened around a specific time interval. 

E.g.

\- We will have a model that detects various issues (anomaly detection based software which we already have). So we now have the list of issues that happened across the stack around a certain time interval. Lets say 10 issues

\- Now let s say we have 10 different issues that happens around a particular time interval (1-5 mins), we would like to send all the 10 issues to AI based system and we want it to tell that out of these 10 issues, 1 or 2 issues is most probably the root cause which could have caused all the other issues.

If we have such AI based system that will basically CORRELATE multiple issues and tell us the ROOT CAUSE i.e. basically which of those issues is likely to have caused the other issues, that will be very useful.

Is this possible? Any thoughts/guidance will be greatly appreciated. What are all the typical algorithms/approaches people apply for this kind of problem.

Imagine a use case for this where if we have this systems, I can send in a bunch of alerts coming in (assume the alert has the relevant data about the issue attached to it) and this AI system can process it and segregate those alerts in a such a way, it informs the user which alert is actual issue which is causing other. This would mean user can quickly resolve it getting rid of other alerts. There are many such use cases like this",1636834058.0,2021-11-13 21:07:38
[D] Opinion: the recent paper on buggy resizing libraries is misleading,196,qsl5jj,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qsl5jj/d_opinion_the_recent_paper_on_buggy_resizing/,24,"A recent paper [On Buggy Resizing Libraries and Surprising Subtleties in FID Calculation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11222) claims that the image downsampling methods of OpenCV, Tensorflow and PyTorch are ""buggy"", and therefore PIL should be used instead for FID estimation. The corresponding twitter post was quite popular during the last week.

I believe that this claim and the main figure of the paper is misleading, because the issue is caused by aliasing and it can be fixed by simply setting the right parameters in the functions they used.

&#x200B;

[Their main figure](https://preview.redd.it/9va7lmkwd8z71.png?width=2116&format=png&auto=webp&s=1684c5e6979740787d1bc71d0e32b0bdffb48672)

Though I believe that the discussion on whether antialiasing should be a default in image libraries is valuable, in my opinion none of these methods is ""buggy"", and the paper presents the issue in a sensationalist way.",1636751991.0,2021-11-12 22:19:51

[D] Causality research in ML is a scam (warning: controversial),188,qs7g4t,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qs7g4t/d_causality_research_in_ml_is_a_scam_warning/,146,"Don't get me wrong, causal inference are *the* most methods for application areas where we observe a bunch of random variable and want to figure out the causal relationship between them.

This rant is not about the method is itself, but how ML research is recently getting exploiting the term ""causality"" for the sake of the hype and citations. 

In ML we have two main paradigms: Supervised learning and RL.

Work on causality (e.g., Bernhard Schölkopf, Judea Pearl etc.) tells us that is impossible to determine the causal relationship between variables if we only observe them without performing any interaction. Therefore, with supervised learning we cannot learn a causal model but we need to impose one. Period.

Regarding RL, tabular Q-learning is guaranteed to converge to the maximum expected reward policy. Period. That's it, nothing else needs to be said about it.

However, despite these two fundamental statements, there is currently growing a hype in general ML research about causality. I am completely fine with causality research as long as it focuses on the application area mentioned in my first sentence. But this recent trend brings the concept into computer vision, NLP, etc. , where things become vague quite fast, exaggerated by the fact that research on causality can be already extremely vague and deeply philosophical (e.g., what's the practical implication of Newcomb's paradox).

In computer vision no causal model is known. Even the vision processing of humans or animals is very little understood. Moreover, CV tasks are inherently under-specified. For instance, is a cartoon drawing of an elephant still an elephant? Or is is out-of-distribution (OOD), or its own class, or multiple classes? Are we talking about the causal relationship of pixels, patches, or concepts? What makes an elephant ear an elephant ear?

This vagueness, combined with the general trend in ML of throwing a bunch of overly complex math statements into a paper to impress the reviewers, is really concerning.

I bet that there will be hundreds of papers on this topic be published in the next years that contribute very little to our understanding, but will create millions of (self-) citations.",1636708549.0,2021-11-12 10:15:49

I graduated college recently, all my previous work experience is ML engineering but not active research, rather implementing things people have already done.

I've been in the lab a few months now and it's become clear to me that the standards for code in research are a lot lower than I expected. I am the only one on my team pushing for things like CI pipelines, refactoring, documentation, regression tests, etc. And when I do raise such concerns the usual response is that such things are not worth spending time on. My supervisor once told me that the job of a researcher is not to write good code, it's to find a correct problem formulation, describe it correctly, and then pass it to a software engineer whose job it is to create the high-quality implementation. They emphasised the importance of rapid iteration of the idea rather than going slowly because they're concerned about getting scooped in our current project. This is true to some extent because we are a small and resource-limited group whose experiments can take hours to run, working in a popular field (quadruped legged locomotion).

I struggle a lot with this mindset. I hate looking at the crappy code written by myself and by my teammates and I hate debugging it / trying to understand it. A lot of my time is wasted on things like checking which experimental configuration a model was trained from because we don't have automated logging of that. Aesthetically I also just dislike it, I have high personal standards of code quality (Uncle Bob's *Clean Code,* anyone?) which I feel like I'm constantly breaking when I have to write code for work.

I'm looking for advice on how I can learn to tolerate this better, or other similar resolutions to the problem. Thanks in advance.

==============================================================

Edit: Thank you all for the kind replies so far. I have received many more responses than I was ever expecting to get. It's going to be difficult to reply to each one but I will do my best to read all of them and consider. I will respond here to some general points I've seen made repeatedly.

1. I'm not arrogant enough to think that I know everything about research and coding after 3 months in a lab. And as many have rightly pointed out there's no need for research code to live up to the standards of long-term production code. I do recognize that in this case the problem likely lies (mostly) with me. Hence the title of 'how do I lower my standards' and the question of 'how do I learn to tolerate something I'm not comfortable with'. Seeing how popular this post is, I'm sure this struggle resonates with many others as well. As a result I hope for there to be less cynicism about my motives. The discussion so far has been largely productive and on-topic, I appreciate very much it staying that way.
2. To give some additional context, I am working right now as part of a group. I have a main project which I work on with 1 other person (also a recent graduate). My supervisor actually doesn't look at the code we write at all and as far as I can tell does not care much about code. They seem to implicitly trust that we are able to correctly implement things according to the description (which I believe is true for both of us). At our weekly meetings, we present our progress in the form of videos / graphs / slides. This means that I and my teammate are solely responsible for maintaining the quality of code in our current project, and as mentioned we have philosophical disagreements about how much code quality matters. (I know I am not necessarily right.)
3. The project I am working on is very much not a 'one-off experiment'. Our main codebase is inherited from somebody else who is no longer in the lab (which was itself an iteration on some open-source implementation). We are iterating various elements of the robot's sensor setup in addition to the reinforcement learning algorithm and training curriculum. With well-known off-the-shelf envs like those in MuJoCo I'd be pretty happy accepting that it was working as intended. With code I write myself or code written by other people which is not tested, it's a lot harder to have that confidence.
4. As some have correctly pointed out, using a standard logging tool like W&B would be an easy fix to the time spent on resolving experimental configurations. That issue in particular could be resolved easily by setting up the appropriate pipelines and would likely be a net plus to my team. More generally, I could benefit from critically examining the practices I am used to and seeing which have concrete benefits in my current workplace, and then propose those to the team.
5. I am a strong proponent of unit tests. Unit tests save my butt from making simple mistakes. It's already incredibly difficult to figure out why experiments fail sometimes. I can at least eliminate some of the possible causes by unit-testing code where easy and appropriate. Also, when I do fix a bug, I write a unit test to enforce the fix, and then I can mostly forget about it. That mental real estate can go to things that can't be automated as easily.
6. Similarly, I am a big fan of simple CI pipelines like Github Actions. Perhaps the term 'CI' comes with a lot of associated bells and whistles which are (rightfully) not used in research code, but to me CI is simply a way to automate the manual running of unit tests. With a bit of know-how, Github CI workflows are easy to set up from a cookiecutter template and they save a lot of time as well as mental worry. I like to include linters as well but it's not necessary to the core functionality.",1636699761.0,2021-11-12 07:49:21

"[P] Questions regarding self-supervised learning for music (DINO, MoCo, ...)",5,qshm5b,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qshm5b/p_questions_regarding_selfsupervised_learning_for/,6," 

Hello everyone! First of all, I am pretty inactive on Reddit, so I hope that this is the right place for this post. I am a computer science graduate student focusing on machine learning, working on an interdisciplinary research project regarding the analysis of music.

**TL;DR** 

I try to extract general and descriptive music features on various different levels. 

* Which self-supervised methods can you recommend for limited resource capacities? 
* Which data augmentations to use for music? 
* General tips and tricks for SSL with music? 
* Is it a good idea to use a pretrained backbone in order to get away with a small dataset and compute (e.g. OpenAI's JukeBox VQ-VAE)? 
* Why is my DINO setup not converging?

&#x200B;

**General idea** Rather than solving some specific MIR task (e.g. genre classification), my goal is to extract generic, interpretable and descriptive music features. In other words, I want a model that “perceives” and “understands” music in general without giving it a specific goal. I would then further analyze extracted features, e.g., to find relations to human music perception, or use them for downstream tasks. Ideally, the outcome is a model that can describe music on various different levels (e.g., beat, rhythm, harmony), for example by features extracted from different neural network layers (shallow: low-level, deeper: higher-level). I know that this is by far no easy task, but it is worth investigating the possibilities and limitations in my opinion.

**Which self-supervised learning method?** After some research, self-supervised learning (SSL) seems the way to go here. SSL is a research area that gained momentum over the last two years or so and there are multiple proposed methods, however applied mostly in the computer vision area (images). Additionally, SSL methods seem to be rather data hungry and as you might imagine my resources are quite limited. I have a GTX 1060 available locally, but I am also willing to pay in order to train a model on GPU cloud services (e.g. Lambda GPU). Since my budget is low, I’d like to do all testing locally or on other free alternatives such as Colab in order to find the right method, hyperparameters, etc. for the actual training on a payed server.

**Idea: Using pretrained JukeBox backbone** My idea is to use the pretrained VQ-VAE from OpenAI’s JukeBox (see below) as a backbone and hope that it extracts useful intermediate features, which I can forward to my (comparably small) model. With this I hope to get away with a small dataset (60 hours of music?) and relatively low resource usage, while still achieving reasonable results. Does anyone have experience with such setups? Now to the SSL method itself (ignoring generative models): On the one hand, there are contrastive methods such as CPC, SimCLR or (the less resource hungry?) MoCo. On the other hand, there are methods which do not explicitly formulate a contrastive loss such as BYOL or DINO. Especially the latter one seems interesting. Unfortunately, I have no experience in training such models at all, which is why I wanted to ask the community for some tips and feedback suited for my problem. Preferable methods are those which do not require much hyperparameter tuning (time and compute limitations) or much compute during training (e.g., large batch sizes with SimCLR), but still achieve good results.

**DINO not working properly** Currently I am testing the DINO method on a very limited setup locally: My dataset consists of a very small portion of the FMA dataset (90 minutes of music) with a sample size of 4 seconds and a batch size of 14 using the LARS optimizer. Additionally, I have adopted the audio augmentation strategy from a paper that applies SimCLR to music (CLMR, see below). I am very happy about ideas for other/better music augmentations for my problem, though. However, the model does not seem to converge properly. The loss decreases quite quickly after a few epochs. After a while however the model seems to collapse, and the loss increases rapidly staying high over the remaining epochs. I figure this has something to do with the momentum hyperparameter (i.e., how much of the student’s weights get transferred to the teacher after each iteration). When increasing this number, the collapse effect is minimized or is non-existent at all, if large enough, but the loss does not really decrease much either. I have logged everything and computed stats for several epochs, if anyone is interested. When splitting the loss up into the teacher entropy and the KL divergence between the student and the teacher, one can see that the collapse is caused by the entropy part. Does anyone have experience with DINO or similar methods and might have a clue why this is happening? As mentioned, I can give more details about the hyperparameters, logs, statistics, etc. Is it possible that this phenomenon is due to the small dataset and batch size on my local machine, and it would diminish on the cloud with a larger dataset and/or batch size? Though they mentioned in the paper that they have successfully tested their method even with a batch size of 8.

I know this is a lengthy post, but I wanted to share as much detail as possible about my goal and resulting problems. Hope anyone might give some feedback.

[D] Why do CNN Kernel weights reach high values?,3,qse2ov,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qse2ov/d_why_do_cnn_kernel_weights_reach_high_values/,2,"I've recently read a bunch of literature about network pruning. A common criteria in the field is to select kernels that are to be removed by their L1 Magnitude (e.g. \[1\], \[2\]), as the heuristic apparently catches relevant kernels quite well.

Most often the time the CNNs are trainied with some form of weight decay. This is (IMHO) intended to regularize the model and prevent single kernel weights from dominating the entire set of parameters and distribute relevance across multiple channels. Also it is normal to add BatchNorm to the architecture as it stabilizes the training procedure.

I'd argue that:

1. The only relevant thing for detecting a pattern is the relative weight between the kernel weights. The absolute value does not matter as it will only change the value range. (CNN Kernels are a Matrix multiplication and therefore a single scaling factor would do the same as scaling the entire thing.).
   1. As the kernel is followed by a BatchNorm the values get automatically scaled and zero-meaned before getting scaled and shifted, so there is less reason for that. (When using Conv-Bn-ReLU ordering)
2. With any weight penalty this should lead to continuously & slowly decreasing values of the kernel weights (Except in the BatchNorms which is way more ""penalty efficient"" than a kernel.

The only reason I could think of is that one will run into some numeric stability issues when one approaches the minimum resolution of the data format (i.e. float16/32). Maybe this introduces some sort of noise into the optimization process?

However as the evidence shows that we get higher weights I have to be wrong and would be happy to get shown where my thought process breaks down.

I hope to get some help understanding Google's [Total Relighting: Learning to Relight Portraits for Background Replacement](https://augmentedperception.github.io/total_relighting/total_relighting_paper.pdf) paper. I'm stuck on the adversarial loss. In 4.1 Paper says:

>we add an adversarial loss on the face region to help the network learn to plausibly remove high-frequency shading effects from the input image while maintaining image detail. We use a least squares discriminator \[Mao et al. 2017\] disc^(alb) to add a loss between a crop of the face from the ground truth albedo 𝐴crop\_gt and a matching crop of the face from the predicted albedo 𝐴crop

Predicted albedo 𝐴crop is the face crop of the output of U-Net like network. No other details provided and I'm struggling to understand the setup here. Since in the paper they're using both ground truth and predicted albedo as the inputs for the loss, I can imagine two scenarios:

1. Use the loss from the original LSGAN paper and train the discriminator during the model training, which seems counterintuitive to me
2. Use L1 or L2 distance between pretrained discriminator's output for ground truth and prediction, but that is not really adversarial loss I guess.

I have no experience with such discriminator usage and therefore can't choose between these two or come up with something else reasonable. 

Is there a common way to use GAN discriminator for the loss calculation of ""non-GAN"" networks? Because from the paper it sounds like something that doesn't require deeper explanation",1636722057.0,2021-11-12 14:00:57

They are that good.  I am talking about automatic model selection, automatic tuning, and NLP that is just breaking away from the old limitations and old ways of doing projects.

See, on youtube lately I am watching all these ""data scientists"" posting videos where all they do is run the software that Microsoft and Google made, and call it a day.  They don't even change the default settings and they add nothing of their own talents (if they have them).  

And the results are pretty good, by golly. That's the thing. 

 Automatic feature engineering is one of the hallmarks of the top deep neural networks. People have spent careers in linguistics and computer vision, hand-making parts and hand-curating mathematical techniques that are now often completely bypassed by today's ML techniques baked into free software, and that's just one example of many.

It's not a trivial question. 

There's more to data science than making a predictive model on a canned, fixed public dataset like Iris, Titanic, Jewellery, or even Higgs Boson. There's also MLOps, exploratory data analysis, study design, visualization, data wrangling, data quality assurance, data life cycle, and many other areas. Data science has wide scope and many specialties.  Predictive model making is only about 5 percent of the whole ML and DS job now, according to a presentation I saw yesterday.

But modeling might be about to be fully automated soon. Can you as a ML engineer or data scientist, bring your wide and deep talents to bear, to actually show that you can make a model better than a script kiddie on predictive performance on any -- any at all -- well known open dataset?

I found it interesting and the authors claim multiple times in the paper that 'we release our code at '[https://github.com/Manojbhat09/Trajformer](https://github.com/Manojbhat09/Trajformer)'. Turns out they never did, fine, I thought perhaps they will in the future and starred the repo to check it out later.

Many others raised issues asking for update on code release and they never replied. Finally, it April they update the readme to say that they will release the code and that's been the last update.

I know this is a common trend in ML papers now, but what sucks is that I emailed the authors (both the grad student and the PI) multiple times asking for an update an they never replied. Their paper is literally based on empirical improvements and without working code to replicate the results it is their word against mine.

I strongly think things have to change, and I believe they only will if we call them out. I waited long enough, and made significant effort to contact the authors with no response. I mean I don't mind them not releasing their code, but at least don't claim that you did in the paper/review phase and then disappear. An undergrad in my lab asked why she should take time to clean up the code and document it before release while others just move on to the next interesting project and I don't have an answer.

To do this, they often refer to masked language modeling (MLM) in BERT-style pre-training and say that we must first discretize the continuous input into discrete tokens  (e.g. using a VQ-VAE) before making predictions (i.e. classification-task over possible tokens in the dictionary).

One of the argument is that the predicting discrete tokens allows the model to learn high-level concepts whereas making prediction in the original input-space (e.g. raw pixels) will force the model to learn high-frequency/low-level details that are not useful for representation learning/compression, and is also computationally prohibitive (since the original input-space is likely very high-dimensional). However my question is why can't we do regression in a continuous latent space for the masked positions (e.g. predicting the latent representation of a learned continuous VAE for the masked positions) instead of classification in a discrete latent space (e.g. predicting the discrete tokens of a learned VQ-VAE for the masked positions)?

Many here can build a simple Machine Learning model to predict whether a customer will *churn* if they get a nice `pandas.DataFrame` with customer data. However, it gets really complicated if you want this model **deployed** and **integrated** in production, say a procedure as such:

1. Pull data from a new customer from **Shopify**
2. Predict for this customer whether they will *churn*
3. If we predict `CHURN == True`
4. Send a discount code to this customer with **Mailchimp**

Suddenly we have to code data integrations, ETL pipelines, deploy our original Machine Learning solution, spin up an HTTP server etc.; a huge pain indeed...

We are building [a framework](https://flow.magicsheets.io) that takes care of exactly all the boring stuff described above. We really believe this will **bridge the gap between research and real-world ML**.

Apologies if the question is a bit naive as I only have passing familiarity with ML (full stack developer by trade). I'm really just looking for more insight into the implementation and consequences of bound constraints with CMA-ES optimization. I did come across ([Biedrzycki, 2019](https://staff.elka.pw.edu.pl/~rbiedrzy/publ/RBSWEVO_CMA_BCHMs.pdf))  which discusses this topic, and a lot of the paper's findings at least come across as fairly natural, but I'm not finding a lot out there and I'm just wondering whether anybody else has any recommendations for further reading or personal stories of potential pitfalls. In the problem I'm dealing with specifically, each of the coordinates in my mutant/search point vectors need to be bound within the unit interval and I wanted to make sure I wasn't walking into any easily preventable mistakes.

**Background Context**:  I'm currently working on a personal project (inspired by this popular [Geijtenbeek, et al., 2013](https://www.goatstream.com/research/papers/SA2013/index.html) paper) where I've implemented a Hill-type muscle model and rigged up a humanoid model with some 200+ ""muscles"" approximating human skeletal muscle function.

We just released our latest paper on arXiv. We explore the idea of fast summation algorithms (equivalent of the Fast Fourier Transform but with Taylor series instead) in the context of Computer Vision. In terms of computational complexity, our approach disentangles the number of model parameters (N) and model evaluations (M), i.e. our approach is in O(N+M) instead of O(NM). This allows us to reduce the number of FLOPs required for training and inference 150-200x depending on the problem.

Unfortunately, our current implementation is very FLOP inefficient and a FLOP efficient implementation requires a good bit of custom CUDA code. We are working on it :)

Diffusion models have made large advances in recent months as a new type of generative models. This paper introduces Autoregressive Diffusion Models (ARDMs), which are a mix between autoregressive generative models and diffusion models. ARDMs are trained to be agnostic to the order of autoregressive decoding and give the user a dynamic tradeoff between speed and performance at decoding time. This paper applies ARDMs to both text and image data, and as an extension, the models can also be used to perform lossless compression.

[D] How to avoid CPU bottlenecking in PyTorch - training slowed by augmentations and data loading?,9,qr0rck,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qr0rck/d_how_to_avoid_cpu_bottlenecking_in_pytorch/,20,"Hello

My colleague and I are training models on a few workstations and we are noticing some bottlenecks that are not leveraging all our GPUs and stopping us from reaching full performance. We are curious what techniques folks use in Python / PyTorch to fully make use of the available CPU cores to keep the GPUs saturated, data loading or data formatting tricks, etc.

Firstly our systems:

* 1 AMD 3950 Ryzen, 128 GB Ram 3x 3090 FE - M2 SSDs for Data sets
* 1 Intel i9 10900k, 64 GB Ram, 2x 3090 FE - M2 SSDs for Data Sets

We notice that both of our systems take the same amount of time per epoch - ie - we get no gains with 3 GPUs vs 2 GPUs, which is frustrating.

Some things we are observing:
* CPUs on both systems spike to 100% CPU on occasion but aren't always utilized
* Disk throughput via IOTOP shows around 50 - 55 MB/s max read, which is way below SSD speeds. Surprisingly low.
* GPU usage is very spikey. 

[Here's an image of NVTop and HTop for both systems](https://imgur.com/a/MhFuISB)

Some things we are doing: 

* We are using PyTorch 1.10
* Pillow-Simd and the latest Nvidia NGC containers. We also use PyTorch Lighting for training. 
* [We follow most of the best practices here](https://tigress-web.princeton.edu/~jdh4/PyTorchPerformanceTuningGuide_GTC2021.pdf)
* We are setting to gradient to none instead of zero grad for performance small improvements
* We are setting cu-DNN auto-benchmark to true
* We are using the Distributed Data Parallel accelerator 
* We are using Pinned Memory.
* We are using num_workers = 8
* We see this behavior of low GPU usage / without augmentations.
* We've reduced batch size as an experiment to see where the issues lie. We are at 1/3rd max possible batch size - and we see maybe a 10-20% difference in performance 

Some things we have observed:

* We get intermittent crashing if we increase num workers above 8 - 
* We've noticed GPU 0 on our 3 GPU system is sometimes idle (which would explain performance differences). However its unclear to us why that may be. [Similar to this issue](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/discussions/2701)

Our guess is image loading and pre-processing appear to be the issue? We aren't entirely sure if we are diagnosing this correctly.

How are folks getting around issues like these? Should we be pre-processing our data set somehow and storing it in a more optimal format? We are relying on Pillow-Simd for image reading, decoding and copying to tensors.

Are there any good pragmatic guides to optimizing training?

However, these methods are frequently too complicated and costly to be broadly used.

Researchers from MIT, National Taiwan University, and the University of California, Santa Barbara, have developed a simple technique that minimizes the complexity of a sophisticated speech-learning model, allowing it to run more efficiently and achieve higher performance.

Their method entails deleting unneeded components from a standard but complex speech recognition model and then making slight tweaks to recognize a given language. Teaching this model an unusual language is a low-cost and time-efficient process because only minor adjustments are required once the larger model is trimmed down to size.

"[D] Mel Spectrum, is it useful for non-speech recognition classification tasks?",4,qr1pex,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qr1pex/d_mel_spectrum_is_it_useful_for_nonspeech/,7,"I am working on a long-term project involving the development of a process monitoring program for an additive manufacturing process. I have read a good deal on different techniques used in audio classification, speech recognition, etc. From what I understand, most machine learning models involving audio either use features extracted from the time and frequency representations of the signal or spectrograms as inputs.

When looking into audio feature extraction, I have noticed it is very common to extract frequency-domain features from the mel spectrum. Obviously, the mel spectrum is very useful in speech recognition tasks since it is intended to align with how a human ear perceives sound. My question: is the mel spectrum useful for audio classification or anomaly detection tasks that do not involve human speech? If so, what is the reason it would be more useful than say the standard frequency scale spectrum for a non speech recognition task?

Here is a quick summary of the paper

* Gradient exploding in the classifier of ACGAN can cause an undesirable training collapse.
* Simply normalizing feature embeddings can resolve the problem.
* Using the normalization technique, we propose the Rebooted Auxiliary Classifier GAN (ReACGAN).
* ReACGAN achieves state-of-the-arts generation results on benchmark datasets. 
* ReACGAN harmonizes with various GAN architectures (DCGAN, ResNet, Big ResNet, StyleGAN2), adversarial losses, and differentiable augmentations (ADA, DiffAugment).

We offer an opportunity for product teams and data scientists to solve the problem of reliable vector data storage, scalability, and undisturbed availability.

We store embeddings and their attributes, which are more interesting to users since they can use real-world objects. For example, they can identify objects using their real identification.

We support changing indexes as new data arrives (delete, change, or add data to the index) parallel with search queries.

You can expand multiple indexes over a single data source (vectors and attributes) and seamlessly transition to new versions of indexes. You can expand different indexes with different parameters of the same data.

You can work with vectors of any type. For example, you can use bag-of-words to solve word processing problems and load appropriate sparse vectors into Vektonn.

We'd appreciate any feedback or suggestions for the project and welcome GitHub stars to join in if, of course, you find it interesting. 🙂

The new training method works by utilizing a  pretrained network to obtain embeddings for real and fake images that the discriminator processes. Additionally, feature pyramids provide multi-scale feedback from multiple discriminators and random projections better utilize deeper layers of the pretrained network.

I don't know if you remember, but we were going to have AMAs here to celebrate the fact that there are so many of us! 
Naturally, since this is a niche subreddit, it wasn't as if top-tier mlops superheroes were lining up to post an AMA here...


But then, a miracle happened! 



I am delighted to announce that [Alessya Visnjic](https://twitter.com/zalessya/status/1457763397106241540?s=20) will be doing an AMA. Here, this Thursday! So spread the word, and let's make this AMA be the first of many successful ones.


And just in case you are not as immersed in the MLOps ecosphere as I am, here is her bio:


>Alessya Visnjic is the CEO and co-founder of WhyLabs, the AI Observability company on a mission to build the interface between AI and human operators. Before WhyLabs, Alessya was a CTO-in-residence at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2), evaluating the commercial potential for the latest advancements in AI research. Earlier in her career, Alessya spent 9 years at Amazon leading Machine Learning adoption and tooling efforts. She was a founding member of Amazon's first ML research center in Berlin, Germany. Alessya is also the founder of Rsqrd AI, a global community of 1,000+ AI practitioners committed to making AI technology Robust & Responsible. 

Of course, there's always an ulterior motive. Alessya will be focusing on the recent announcements by WhyLabs - their round of funding and their new SaaS solution called AI Observatory. 

Personally, I think their corner of the MLOps tooling space is super exciting, and WhyLabs are doing some hard opensource groundwork. Additionally, their marketing is not spammy, so it's an honor to host them on the sub.",1636489878.0,2021-11-09 21:31:18

[P] GPT-3 in the style of Shel Silverstein,12,qqdkeo,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qqdkeo/p_gpt3_in_the_style_of_shel_silverstein/,0,"I've recently been playing with the OpenAI API beta for GPT-3, and used their fine-tuning API to create a model that has been fine-tuned on a corpus of all of Shel Silverstein's poetry. The resulting model generates whimsical poems based on a prompted title.

Here's one example I liked, ""Walking On a Whale""

> I am walking on a whale,

> I feel it move and swell,

> I feel the mist come in and float,

> I feel the rain and the cold.

> But I don't mind at all-

> It's just like walking on the ground.

While the model is quite good at understanding semantics, and even has a flair for the vaguely metaphorical, it didn't pick up any notion of rhyming. It seems like this would be a hard thing for the model to learn given the training data it's seen, since only very rarely does the rhyme scheme affect the conditional likelihood of a word.

Question for any commenters: if you had a rhyming dictionary where you could simply look up whether two words rhyme instead of trying to infer this as some latent attribute, how could you update a large NLP model like this to take into account such declarative knowledge?

Abstract: ""Spurred on by recent successes in causal inference competitions, Bayesian nonparametric (and high-dimensional) methods have recently seen increased attention in the causal inference literature. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of Bayesian nonparametric applications to causal inference. Our aims are to (i) introduce the fundamental Bayesian nonparametric toolkit; (ii) discuss how to determine which tool is most appropriate for a given problem; and (iii) show how to avoid common pitfalls in applying Bayesian nonparametric methods in high-dimensional settings. Unlike standard fixed-dimensional parametric problems, where outcome modeling alone can sometimes be effective, we argue that most of the time it is necessary to model both the selection and outcome processes.""",1636428613.0,2021-11-09 04:30:13

The challenge I am facing is that the quality of the output is somewhat subjective.

This makes it hard to improve the model output - I've easily been able to move beyond outputting gibberish to something which works reasonably well. However, I am not finding it hard to evaluating the effectiveness of minor model changes (e.g. temperature, prompt design, tweaks to the dataset, etc ...)

I'm considering 'crowd sourcing' input from my colleagues, giving them model output (with various tweaks) and asking them to score the results. However, this has obvious limitations!

So, I was wondering if there are techniques that people have developed that make it easier to fine-tune models where the output has a subjective quality?",1636471763.0,2021-11-09 16:29:23

[D] ML datasets for commercial use,0,qpzewi,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qpzewi/d_ml_datasets_for_commercial_use/,3,"Hi all,

there are a ton of datasets to ML researchers stemming from different areas. But when looking more closely, the vast majority of them have very restrictive licensing, only allowing to be used for research purposes, but not in a commercial environment.

I am now wondering what the strategies are for obtaining high quality datasets for commercial purposes. So let's say I want to build a car object detection model for my company, one of the most well known detection use cases.

I can neither use any of the public datasets, as they do not allow commercial usage, nor can I use any of the pre-trained models for this task, as they have been trained on these datasets.

I could now:

* Collect my own data
* Pay crowd-annotators to annotate the data
* Buy data

[D] Recursive ML strategies?,3,qpw3br,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qpw3br/d_recursive_ml_strategies/,8,"I'm looking for ideas on how to use recursive ML strategies, possibly utilizing multiple individual models where one model uses the output of another model to make more accurate predictions.

For example, I use two sklearn `RandomForestClassifier` models to provide a simple signal about the direction of the stock market. The first takes `n` inputs and outputs a prediction. The second takes the original `n` inputs plus the output of the first to make a new prediction. It doesn't provide earth-shattering results, but it appears to be slightly better than only using the one model.

Random forests also provide the ability to use Out-of-Bag samples, which could also be used.

I'm just curious if there any established methods, papers I should look at, etc. that discuss meta or recursive strategies to get the most out of ML models.",1636433341.0,2021-11-09 05:49:01

**Abstract:**

In recent years, numerous machine learning models which attempt to solve polypharmacy side effect identification, drug-drug interaction prediction, and combination therapy design tasks have been proposed. Here, we present a unified theoretical view of relational machine learning models which can address these tasks. We provide fundamental definitions, compare existing model architectures and discuss performance metrics, datasets, and evaluation protocols. In addition, we emphasize possible high-impact applications and important future research directions in this domain.

**The paper provides:**

\- A unified model of drug pair scoring models with a general architecture design recipe.  
\- Model design comparisons based on architecture and input modalities.  
\- Evaluation metrics used by the most important papers.  
\- Public datasets that are relevant.  
\- Evaluation regime designs for stratified splits

**The Github repo comes with:**

\- Paper links with implementations.

&#x200B;

Large part of the current work of our developers is dedicated to manual work on data. This is done in several stages of the development:

1. In the beginning when we get the annotated data we go over it (thousands of images). For segmentation tasks we observe the annotated images to validate the annotation correctness and images relevance for our tasks. Some images may be correctly annotated, but not relevant to our task or use-case so we remove them.
2. We check statistics of the data to validate that the data isn't biased. For example that we have enough samples from each class, and that the distribution of instances sizes (e.g. number of pixels in the segmentation mask) within the classes is reasonable.
3. When we have a trained model, we go over images for which the model gives poor results, and try to find similarities to understand weaknesses of the model and find root causes. This often leads to change of the data and repeating stages 1,2 and eventually 3.

These are very time consuming tasks, and we are looking for MLops tools that will make this work more efficient. Optimally, the tool will also take care of other MLops aspects, like experiments orchestration, experiment tracking and data versioning. We can also combine several tools, but using few (one?) tools is preferred. Open source or proprietary paid product are both possible.

Any recommendations?

The dataset contains 72 games from patch 11.21 (last patch) where the game ended in an early surrender. These games were chosen as the game lengths were guaranteed to be low which kept the dataset from being too large.
To download the dataset, go to [this](https://github.com/MiscellaneousStuff/tlol) GitHub link and click on the `Google Drive Link`. The dataset is stored as an SQLite database file and the schema should be relatively self-explanatory. Happy to answer any questions.

This is just a preliminary dataset which demonstrates that this is possible. Within the next few days the dataset will contain 1000s of replays which means 10,000s of champions worth of data (for each time a player plays a champion).

Edit: Database now contains all 191 early surrender games (games ending at or before 3.5 minutes) in the dataset.
This table shows the top 10 champion occurrences within the dataset.

| Champion     | No. |
| ------------ | --- |
| Nami         | 116 |
| Miss Fortune | 103 |
| Lucian       | 61  |
| Khazix       | 36  |

| Yone         | 30  |
| Camille      | 29  |
| Graves       | 29  |

Edit 2: Larger dataset containing 987 games targeting Miss Fortune in the early game (up to first 5 minutes) with the same schema and format as the first dataset. Also contains all game objects recorded 4 times a second. The games were chosen by getting the games where the MF player lived the longest. This gave a dataset where the players overall had a 64.4% win rate in roughly EUW Diamond II.

Edit 3: A further 728 games also targeting Miss Fortune in the early game (up to first 5 minutes) with the same schema and format as the first and second dataset. This brings the total number of games for the MF-Longevity datasets to 1,715 or
`1,715 games * (5 minutes * 60 seconds * 4 frames/second) := 2,058,000 frames in total.`
This should now be enough to at least create a deep learning agent which can play Miss Fortune for the first five minutes of a game at least to a basic level.

Edit 4: Another day another dataset. A further 773 games from the `MFLongevity` dataset have been uploaded.

GPTSD is a series of images and text created with GPT2 which explores the transfer of trauma from human to machine back to human via machine learning models. By converting human portraits to text, GPT2 is able to recreate new text base portraits and dream recollections based off the dream diary of a Vietnam war veteren.

I'm working on a project where I'm trying to train an airplane to control itself in a 2D setting.

The neural network that acts as the airplane's pilot has 2 outputs that are related to the control of the airplane's altitude (angle of attack and throttle, for those that are familiar).

Unfortunately, my network is outputing numbers that have a completely wrong order of magnitude. I tried writing my own activation function to limit their values, but I'm simply getting the max or min allowable value (since my actual output is off the scale).

Is there any way to control the order of magnitude of the outputs? I've tried a ton of things, from intitializing weights to be extremely small, to normalization of the input.",1636220978.0,2021-11-06 18:49:38
"[N] TF/Keras in Hugging Face, Datasets Edition",64,qnhf5f,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qnhf5f/n_tfkeras_in_hugging_face_datasets_edition/,8,"Hi all, Tensorflow maintainer at Hugging Face here! I [posted here a few months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/ok81v4/n_tf_keras_and_transformers/) about the big change we were making to the library to make everything Keras-native, and people seemed to like it, so I thought I'd give another update on what's changed since then. We've made a couple of big changes that reduce the amount of duplicate, boilerplate code in common scripts massively, and we'd love to get people using the new approaches and get feedback!

**What happened in last week's episode of Hugging Face?**

The story up until now is that all our models are now Keras models. You can still write your own training loop or use the models as a layer in a larger model; everything like that remains unchanged, but it's incredibly convenient to just load a model, then just immediately `compile()` and `fit()` it. I gave some examples in the post I linked above.

**""Last week"" usually refers to times less than four months ago.**

You aren't telling me anything that isn't already in my performance reviews, don't worry.

**At least you delivered eventually. What's new?**

So the first big new change is a really nice integration with 🤗 Datasets. If you're unfamiliar, Datasets is the data equivalent to Hugging Face's model hub - you just load any uploaded dataset in one line of code the same way you load a pretrained model, with the `load_dataset()` function. 

It's not just for NLP - people are using Transformers for audio and vision and everything else these days, so there's [all kinds of data](https://huggingface.co/datasets) in there. You should check it out!

To see an example of `load_dataset()` in action, a standard workflow with Datasets and Transformers goes something like this:

    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification
    from datasets import load_dataset
    
    # Load a pretrained model and its tokenizer
    model_name = 'bert-base-cased'
    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
    model = TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)
    
    # Load a dataset - we'll use the COLA dataset from the GLUE benchmark
    data = load_dataset(""glue"", ""cola"")
    
    # Define a function to tokenize the data, then apply it to the dataset.
    # The tokenizer returns a dict, and map() will add keys from that dict
    # to the dataset as columns
    def tokenize_function(dataset):
        return tokenizer(dataset['sentence'])
    
    tokenized_dataset = data.map(tokenize_function)

So far, so good, but this is the point where problems start to arise, because it's really hard to get the tokenized data into your model. The data is often 1) quite large and 2) jagged, because different samples will tokenize to arrays of different lengths. As a result, if you want to load the data as a single dict of `np.ndarray` or `tf.Tensor`, you end up having to do huge amounts of padding, which bloats memory usage and massively slows down the model. The way to get good performance is to load random batches of samples and only pad that batch, not the entire dataset, but doing that basically required you to write a custom training loop, or at the very least a Python generator, before it would work with Keras. 

If anyone was using Transformers with TF before now I'd love to hear how you were solving this, because it was a huge recurring pain for me.

**So is there a solution now?**

There is!  The solution is that we added the method `to_tf_dataset()` to all our datasets. This basically wraps the dataset in a `tf.data.Dataset`, which will do the just-in-time data padding you want. We've also updated our `DataCollator` classes to work with this, so you can generate your dataset like so:

    from transformers import DataCollatorWithPadding
    
    data_collator = DataCollatorWithPadding(tokenizer=tokenizer, return_tensors=""tf"")
    
    tf_dataset = tokenized_dataset['train'].to_tf_dataset(
        columns=[""input_ids"", ""attention_mask"", ""labels""],
        batch_size=16,
        shuffle=True,
        collate_fn=data_collator
    )

Note how the data collator needs your model's `tokenizer` \- that's because every **god damned** research group in every **god damned** university in every **god damned** country handles their data in a slightly different way, and so there's no universal approach to padding that works for all of the hundreds of different models out there.  We do guarantee, though, that the `tokenizer` that comes with a given `model` will have a `pad()` method that works for that model, and that's what the `data_collator` will use. You have no idea how much pain you're being saved with that method.

**Okay calm down, what do I do with this tf\_dataset?**

That bit's easy! A lot of people aren't that familiar with `tf.data`, but it's actually really cool. Once you have a `tf.data.Dataset`, you can pass it straight to `model.fit()` or just iterate over it in a for loop to get batches.

**Won't I need to compile this model before I can fit() it? What loss should I use?**

That's a great question! And that brings me to the second big change we've made. Our models now **automatically compute losses that are suitable for their task in a way that's accessible to Keras.** In other words, if you use `TFAutoModelForSequenceClassification`, that model will now compute a loss appropriate for sequence classification tasks (i.e. crossentropy) for you! Don't know what loss you need to train GPT-2 with? No problem - `TFAutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained('gpt2')` will do it for you.

**Wait, stop! I'm an advanced user and I want my loss, not your loss!**

Don't panic! You can still use whatever loss you want, and all old code will work exactly as it did before. The only change is that if you `compile()` your model without a loss, it'll interpret that as you wanting the default internal loss. If you specify a loss argument to `compile()`, then it'll use that and not the internal loss. In addition, this only applies when using the Keras API, like `fit()`. If you're writing manual training loops or using the model as a layer in a larger model, none of this is relevant to you. This is just a convenience, and it's easy to disable!

**So I just... skip the loss argument?**

Exactly! If we continue on the code samples from above, all you need to do is:

    from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
    optimizer = Adam(3e-5)  # Transformers work much better with lower LRs
    
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer)  # No loss argument!
    
    model.fit(tf_dataset)

And that's it! Dataset loaded, tokenized and trained on. With changes to a few lines almost any NLP task from translation to token classification or summarization can be handled in a similar way.

If you want to see more, we have [a bunch of example notebooks in both TensorFlow and PyTorch](https://huggingface.co/transformers/notebooks.html), and all the TF examples should be up-to-date with these new methods.",1636136930.0,2021-11-05 19:28:50

* As it turns out, the Arch-Net is actually building a bridge that translates between computer architectures of ASIC chips and neural network model architectures by changing existing floating-point DNNs into hardware-friendly quantized Arch-Net.
* The structure of ArchNet is made up of five operators: 3×3 Convolutions, Batch Normalization, Concatenation, 2×2 Max-pooling, and Fully-Connected layers.
* The conversion to Arch-Net is much simpler without labeled data as researchers employ Blockwise Model Distillation on feature maps.
* Researchers did extensive experiments on image classification and machine translation tasks to confirm that Arch-Net is both effective, efficient and fast.

[Discussion] Applied machine learning implementation debate. Is OOP approach towards data preprocessing in python an overkill?,201,qm6ieq,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qm6ieq/discussion_applied_machine_learning/,86,"***TL;DR***:

* I am trying to find ways to standardise the way we solve things in my Data Science team, setting common workflows and conventions
* To illustrate the case I expose a *probably-over-engineered* OOP solution for Preprocessing data.
* The OOP proposal is neither relevant nor important and I will be happy to do things differently (I actually apply a functional approach myself when working alone). The main interest here is to **trigger conversations towards** **proper project and software architecture, patterns and best practices among the Data Science community.**

# Context

I am working as a Data Scientist in a big company and I am trying as hard as I can to set some best practices and protocols to standardise the way we do things within my team, ergo, changing the extensively spread and overused Jupyter Notebook practices and start building a proper workflow and reusable set of tools.

In particular, the idea is to define a common way of doing things (workflow protocol) over 100s of projects/implementations, so anyone can jump in and understand whats going on, as the way of doing so has been enforced by process definition. As of today, every Data Scientist in the team follows a procedural approach of its own taste, making it sometimes cumbersome and non-obvious to understand what is going on. Also, often times it is not easily executable and hardly replicable.

I have seen among the community that this is a recurrent problem. eg:

* [https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/q7ey06/d\_tired\_of\_writing\_mundane\_data\_wrangling\_code/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/q7ey06/d_tired_of_writing_mundane_data_wrangling_code/)

In my own opinion, many Data Scientist  are really in the crossroad between Data Engineering, Machine Learning Engineering, Analytics and Software Development, knowing about all, but not necessarily mastering any.  Unless you have a CS background (I don't), we may understand very well ML concepts and algorithms, know inside-out **Scikit Learn** and **PyTorch,** but there is no doubt that we sometimes lack software development basics that really help when building something bigger.

I have been searching general applied machine learning best practices for a while now, and even if there are tons of resources for general architectures and design patterns in many other areas, I have not found a clear agreement for the case. The closest thing you can find is cookiecutters that just define a general project structure, not detailed implementation and intention.

# Example: Proposed solution for Preprocessing

For the sake of example, I would like to share a potential structured solution for **Processing**, as I believe it may well be 75% of the job. This case is for the general **Dask** or **Pandas** processing routine, not other huge big data pipes that may require other sort of solutions.

\*\**(if by any chance this ends up being something people are willing to debate and we can together find a common framework, I would be more than happy to share more examples for different processes)*

&#x200B;

>*Keep in mind that the proposal below could be perfectly solved with a functional approach as well. The idea here is to force a team to use the same* ***blueprint*** *over and over again and follow the same* ***structure and protocol***, even if by so the solution may be a bit over-engineered. The blocks are meant to be replicated many times and set a common agreement to always proceed the same way (forced by the abstract class).  
>  
>IMO the final abstraction seems to be clear and it makes easy to understand whats happening, in which order things are being processed, etc... The transformation itself (`main_pipe`) is also clear and shows the steps explicitly.

In a typical routine, there are 3 well defined steps:

* Read/parse data
* Transform data
* Export processed data

Basically, an ETL process. This could be solved in a functional way. You can even go the extra mile by following `pipes` chained methods (as brilliantly explained here [https://tomaugspurger.github.io/method-chaining](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/method-chaining))

It is clear the `pipes` approach follows the same *parse→transform→export* structure. This level of cohesion shows a common pattern that could be defined into an `abstract class`. This `class` defines the bare minimum requirements of a **pipe**, being of course always possible to extend the functionality of any instance if needed.

By defining the `Base class` as such, we explicitly force a cohesive way of defining `DataProcessPipe` (*pipe* naming convention may be substituted by *block* to avoid later confusion with **Scikit-learn** `Pipelines`). This base class contains `parse_data`, `export_data`, `main_pipe` and `process` methods

In short, **it defines a formal interface that describes what any process block/pipe implementation should do.**

A specific implementation of the former will then follow:

    
    from processing.base import DataProcessPipeBase
    
    class Pipe1(DataProcessPipeBase):
    
        name = 'Clean raw files 1'
    
        def __init__(self, import_path, export_path, params):
            self.import_path = import_path
            self.export_path = export_path
            self.params = params
    
        def parse_data(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
            df = pd.read_csv(self.import_path)
            return df
    
        def export_data(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> None:
            df.to_csv(os.path.join(self.export_path, index=False)
            return None
    
        def main_pipe(self, df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
            return (df
                     .dropnan()
                     .reset_index(drop=True)
                     .pipe(extract_name, self.params['extract'])
                     .pipe(time_to_datetime, self.params['dt'])
                     .groupby('foo').sum()
                     .reset_index(drop=True))
    
        def process(self) -> None:
            df = self.parse_data()
            df = self.main_pipe(df)
            self.export_data(df)
            return None

With this approach:

* The ins and outs are clear (this could be one or many in both cases and specify imports, exports, even middle exports in the `main_pipe` method)
* The interface allows to use indistinctly **Pandas**, **Dask** or any other library of choice.
* If needed, further functionality beyond the `abstractmethods` defined can be implemented.

Note how parameters can be just passed from a **yaml** or **json** file.

For complete processing pipelines, it will be needed to implement as many DataProcessPipes required. This is also convenient, as they can easily be then executed as follows:

    from processing.pipes import Pipe1, Pipe2, Pipe3
    
    class DataProcessPipeExecutor:
        def __init__(self, sorted_pipes_dict):
            self.pipes = sorted_pipes_dict
    
        def execute(self):
            for _, pipe in pipes.items():
                pipe.process()
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        PARAMS = json.loads('parameters.json')
        pipes_dict = {
            'pipe1': Pipe1('input1.csv', 'output1.csv', PARAMS['pipe1'])
            'pipe2': Pipe2('output1.csv', 'output2.csv', PARAMS['pipe2'])
            'pipe3': Pipe3(['input3.csv', 'output2.csv'], 'clean1.csv', PARAMS['pipe3'])
        }
        executor = DataProcessPipeExecutor(pipes_dict)
        executor.execute()

## Conclusion

Even if this approach works for me, I would like this to be just an example that opens conversations towards proper project and software architecture, patterns and best practices among the Data Science community. I will be more than happy to flush this idea away if a better way can be proposed and its highly standardised and replicable.

If any, the main questions here would be:

* Does all this makes any sense whatsoever for this particular example/approach?
* Is there any place, resource, etc.. where I can have some guidance or where people are discussing this?

Thanks a lot in advance

As I have viewed some related works, I found that most of them merely sample a latent vector from some distribution with fixed size *(e.g a latent vector of dim 64)*, and after some upsampling operation, they will get signals in a fixed window size *(e.g a signal of 4s \* 256Hz = 1024 points)*.

I want to get rid of the annoying limit of ""fixed window size"", and be able to generate continuous signal with arbitrary length. 

I tried to code by myself. I have designed a GAN framework , in which the generator takes an input of an arbitrary length of vector, and outputs a signal in same length as the input. The upsampling process is thrown away here, so the generator merely do some modification on the input signal instead of upsampling on it. As for discriminator, I use global average pooling in replace of the linear layers. However, my code failed to work. So I think maybe I need some new ideas.

I come to you guys for help. Do you know any paper that might be helpful for me? Or do you have any good idea?

In engineering design applications, such uncertainties may arise from production tolerances, operational conditions as well as other environmental factors. Thus, the distribution of these features can be measured and to some extent modified (e.g. by moving the mean value).

Design uncertainty optimization seeks to find the distribution parameters of input features, which optimize metrics such as the failure probability and the variance of key performance indicators besides the expected objective values. Since these often require uncertainty quantification of black-box functions, the whole process is computationally quite burdensome. In this work, we propose using machine learning methods in combination with sequential sampling to reduce the required amount of computation and accelerate the uncertainty optimization task. Due to the small data setting, we limit the investigation to GPR and SVR but argue that a more suitable model can exist depending on the problem, which could be used within the proposed framework instead.

we're building a platform that turns code into an API , hosted by us. infrastructure is paid by whoever calls your service (we charge the exact amount the infra costs us) if you choose to you can also monetize your service.

as a data scientist myself I'm really excited about the possibilities of easily sharing my models' capabilities as an API without dealing with dev-ops , but I'm biased because I love what we're building. I really want to know what do you think about using such a platform (not mentioning the name, not sure it's allowed)

how many of you both create ML models and know how to set up your own API (and monetize it)?

we want smart people to create smart solutions and be able to share them easily with anyone.

creating such a service would be free, signing up is free and as a creator you can only earn if someone is using your service.

any thoughts?

Reinforcement Learning methods are notoriously data-hungry. Notably, MuZero learns a latent world model just from scalar feedback of reward- and policy-predictions, and therefore relies on scale to perform well. However, most RL algorithms fail when presented with very little data. EfficientZero makes several improvements over MuZero that allows it to learn from astonishingly small amounts of data and outperform other methods by a large margin in the low-sample setting. This could be a staple algorithm for future RL research.

which libraries or toolboxes would you recommend (ideally based on personal experience) for performing inference in probabilistic graphical models, for an actual practical application and not for academic toy examples?

Minimal requirements: must be able to specify a Bayesian network or factor graph consisting of categorical nodes, some of which are hidden and others observed, and use a set of observations to identify the factors / dependencies. (I think essentially any PGM toolbox will fulfill these requirements?)

Bonus points given for:- good documentation- maturity/stability- works efficiently with many factors and many datapoints- implements many different inference methods and modeling paradigms- simplicity of use

I do know of a few promising toolboxes such as [pgmpy](https://github.com/pgmpy/pgmpy), [pymc3](https://docs.pymc.io/en/stable/), and [pyro](http://pyro.ai/), but have not used either of them (for this purpose) and am at a bit of a loss picking one to start with.",1635976141.0,2021-11-03 22:49:01

 So let's say that I'm trying to classify toxic tweets. I might use an embedding model or a verctorizer to turn the tweet into model features. And then fit some classifier on top of this to try to predict the label from these text features. 

But what if I add some simple zero shot binary features? is\_angry\_model1, is\_sad\_model1, is\_news model1 etc and do this for one or more models?  Or even more simply use, is\_toxic\_model1, is\_toxic\_model2 and use their predictions as input features into a classifier.

I've built a family of models of different sizes/parameter counts using traditional log-loss as my loss function, and each model will make catastrophically bad decisions on occasion.  And for my domain, a few catastrophically bad classifications can ruin tens of thousands of good classifications.  I'm wondering if there's a different loss function I can use that penalizes errors even more heavily than log-loss (log-loss squared?).

The natural question to ask is if I have errors in my data pipeline or model configuration.  I've debugged it quite a bit and I'm sure that's not my problem.

"[N] Researchers From Seoul National University, NVIDIA and Microsoft Release ‘ACAV100M’: An Automatically Curated Video Dataset For Self-Supervised Audio-Visual Learning",4,qlqqow,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qlqqow/n_researchers_from_seoul_national_university/,0,"Audio-visual (AV) learning is defined by delivering and applying instructional content that includes both sound and visual information. The natural relationship between visual observations and their accompanying sounds has shown strong self-supervision signals for learning video representations. That is why the massive amount of online videos has become a valuable source for self-supervised learning among research communities. 

However, due to overdubbed audio, online videos frequently provide imperfectly aligned audio-visual signals. Therefore, the models trained on uncurated films have been shown to develop poorer representations as a result of the misalignment difficulties. The existing techniques typically rely on manually curated datasets with a predetermined taxonomy of semantic ideas, where the audio-visual connection is highly likely.

To overcome this gap, researchers from Seoul National University, NVIDIA and Microsoft have released an automatic dataset curation pipeline and a large video dataset for self-supervised audio-visual learning, termed ACAV100M (automatically curated audio-visual dataset). The dataset is made up of a massive number of uncurated web videos. The researchers took 140 million full-length videos and reduced them to 100 million segments with the best audio-visual correspondence.

Hello,

Assume a training dataset has ten sentences, and they are used for constructing a probabilistic language model consisting of the Maximum Likelihood Estimates for all of the different combinations of bigrams for these ten sentences.  To test the accuracy of this bigram language model, a test dataset consisting of twenty sentences are used for calculating the probability for each of these test sentences using the bigram conditional probabilities that were calculated using all of the sentences in the training set.  To evaluate the accuracy of this bigram language model, there is a need to calculate the Perplexity measure for indicating the accuracy of the probabilistic language model.  Because of the test dataset having twenty sentences, is it correct to calculate the Perplexity value for each of these twenty sentences using their probability values and then taking the average of these twenty Perplexity values for calculating the overall Perplexity value for the test dataset or is it correct to calculate the probability for each of the twenty sentences and then find the simple average of these twenty probability values to give a simple probability average which is then used for calculating the Perplexity value for the test dataset?  Would this procedure apply for a test dataset having any number of sentences?  Would this procedure apply for a trigram model?  Would this procedure apply for any n-gram models like a quadrogram model?  The goal is to always have a probabilistic language model having the lowest Perplexity value.

[D] Neural architecture search and Neuroevolution,9,qlffsv,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qlffsv/d_neural_architecture_search_and_neuroevolution/,2,"Hi fellow readers,

I've come recently to a slight confusion about how to understand NAS and Neuroevolution. This is why I would like to hear your explanations.

My current understanding is as follows:

**NAS** \- technique which can be used to automate the process of designing/optimizing neural networks (NNs) \[[1](https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2020/08/06/neural-architecture-search.html#evaluation-strategy)\]. The technique is further divided into three components such as:

* Search space - defines types of layers, depth, type of connections
* Search strategy - defines the approach used to explore search space
* Evaluation strategy - evaluates the performance of build ANN from its design

**Neuroevolution** \- a technique that harnesses evolutionary algorithms (EA) to design/optimize NNs. It can augment the NN by changing the topology, connections and weights \[[2](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Neuroevolution)\] based on observed action in the environment.

Confusion:

Therefore, from the above description, I don't understand if NAS and Neuroevolution can be explained as applied techniques to design/optimize NN topologies. Where NAS can use any kind of algorithm to design NN topologies (RL, EA, Gradient descent) and Neuroevolution uses only EA?

**OR**

Neuroevolution can be just defined as a search strategy in NAS? This means Neuroevolution can be used in NAS (search strategy) like for example Reinforcement learning (RL) \[[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578)\].

To simplify, I would like to understand, how can I think about NAS and Neuroevolution, when researching. My goal is to understand how I can put all the puzzles together when building an automated machine learning process for a specific task as anomaly detection. 

If I made any mistakes or silly comparisons please point them out in the comments, that future readers can grasp my mistakes and your knowledge. Any comments are more than welcome!

[D] how to correlate the results from an extremely imbalance data to performance relative to a random guess,6,qkwk6j,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qkwk6j/d_how_to_correlate_the_results_from_an_extremely/,17,"Hi all,

At a project at work I handle with an extremely imbalance dataset - 699 cases of positive outcome while around 15,000 negative cases.

In addition, our cases are relatively hard to separate and in some cases domain knowledge experts are struggling with manual classification.

In that context, I was asked to explore different classifiers and present them in a POC report.

At first I tried a naive approach and dumped the data as it is (used a train, validation, test splitting with stratification option on). All the models predicted 0 all the time, to maximize accuracy.
Then, I used over sampling with smote package in python, and changed the criteria to the area under the precision-recall curve. In the text set, I predicted correctly 30% (21/70) and I had a false positive rate of around 12%.
Regardless of possible model modification or boundary (predict 1 if the model predict a higher score than 0.65, for example), I am having some problems in defining my metric to evaluate the results. Our data is imbalanced, so 30% is good? In addition, false negative is strongly worse than false positive.

In addition, today I presented the results to my manager and he asked me to prove him (or argue) that the results are better than random guessing. 

I thought about two things to evaluate my results:
- Randomly draw 1000 observations, with a prior of 5% equal to 1, the rest to 0. Than randomly guess 5% of them to be 1 and compare it to my results. Bootstrap this scheme to get a distribution, and check where is my model performance along the distribution.  

-Take the examples from the test set, assign the same number or normal observations, and give the hr experts to classify them manually. Then compare results.

I will be glad to hear what do you think about the problem and the suggestions.

Thanks :)",1635828087.0,2021-11-02 05:41:27

Hi all,

I recently completed my research based masters in computer vision and currently working in a company as a computer vision researcher. My current role requires a lot of paper reading to improve the existing models. I really like doing research and am satisfied with my current role. I have the following questions 
1. If I decide to pursue a phd, I will not be able to save money for next 3 to 4 years. Which is better 4 years of PhD or 4 years of research job experience?
2. My long term goal is to get a job in big companies like google and Facebook. Most of the computer vision roles in big companies require a phd with multiple publications. Can i join such companies without a phd?
3. My company encourages publishing papers. Let’s say if I publish some papers in next three to four years, would that help me in competing with phd degree holders? Or I would still need an official degree?
4. How hard is to get admission in a good uni after some years of research experience with no publication record?

The Frameworks already parse the graph, or pipeline, or whatever it is they use to matrix multiplications, so why not export a plain code version. (I know it's not the same, but it's probably much easier for the framework Devs to implement this rather than someone external)

I dive straight into my problem. What makes a multi armed bandit problem contextual? I read on [TensorFlow agent tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/agents/tutorials/per_arm_bandits_tutorial#multi-armed_bandits_with_arm_features) that the agent receives the context vector, which is just the observation, at every step, that makes a bandit setting contextual. Isnt every agent in an bandit setting doing this? Since in the MAB problem the agent needs to know on which machine/bandit he is and how much he knows of the probability of the machine. So how does contextual MAB defer from the standard MAB ? Is it for example ""extra"" information ontop? For example he knows wether a machine/bandit has a higher probability if the wether is raining or not?

And the second part of my question is, I'm currently working with Stable Baselines 3. Is here the normal observation function the correlating observation function (context vector) from tf and using the observation in every step making it contextual? Couldnt find any information in the SB3 documentation how the contextual settings work.

To be more specific, my ""extra"" context in my MAB problem is a state machine the bandit uses and each state is an one armed bandit.

I hope this isnt a beginner question and I am tolerated here.",1635756922.0,2021-11-01 09:55:22

Our paper abstract: We study how stochastic differential equation (SDE) based ideas can inspire new modifications to existing algorithms for a set of problems in computer vision. Loosely speaking, our formulation is related to both explicit and implicit strategies for data augmentation and group equivariance, but is derived from new results in the SDE literature on estimating infinitesimal generators of a class of stochastic processes. If and when there is nominal agreement between the needs of an application/task and the inherent properties and behavior of the types of processes that we can efficiently handle, we obtain a very simple and efficient plug-in layer that can be incorporated within any existing network architecture, with minimal modification and only a few additional parameters. We show promising experiments on a number of vision tasks including few shot learning, point cloud transformers and deep variational segmentation obtaining efficiency or performance improvements.",1635709456.0,2021-10-31 20:44:16

[D] What do you think about my idea to boost skip connections in ResNets without performance loss?,8,qivb0y,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qivb0y/d_what_do_you_think_about_my_idea_to_boost_skip/,9,"Consider a small block that has skip connections which is part of some bigger NN.

Symbols: input x, output y, weight w ⊂ D(some distribution). (A very simplified situation for demonstration).

Block: y=x+wx

Suppose some loss L and a given matrix(single number in this case) of gradients dL/dy calculated via backpropagation.

dy/dw = x, dL/dw=dL/dy \* dy/dw = dL/dy \* x

The weight w will be modified as: w -= lr \* (dL/dy \* x).

We also compute **dL/dx=dL/dy \* w** for backprapagation to more early layers.

dy/dx=w, dL/dx=dL/dy \* dy/dx = dL/dy \* w

\------------------------

We can omit the skip connection by initializing the weights as a number v that is 1 bigger than w.

init: v=w+1,  w ⊂ D

Block: y=vx

In this case, dL/dv is computed consistently as the case with the original weight w.

dy/dv = x, dL/dv=dL/dy \* dy/dv = dL/dy \* x

However, the problem is that dL/dx is different because dy/dx=v=w+1 not w:

dy/dx=v=w+1,**dL/dx=dL/dy \* dy/dx = dL/dy \* (w+1)**

This will affect the gradient values of other layers. This is intuitively expandable to more complex operations e.g. matmul and convolution.

\-----------------------

Because of this inconsistency, removing residual connections with a modified initialization is known to yield different(worse) performance from the original ResNet architecture.

What if we initialize the weights with w+1 but define a skip connection function or layer with custom Autograd backward methods like the tutorial below to compute dy/dx as (w-1)? Would this yield exactly the same inference results and gradients compared to a typical skip connection in ResNet? What do you think?

The problem with such skip connections are that they increase the peak memory usage by x2 because we have to cache all the features of x while computing f(x), and they do impact inference time.

[https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/examples\_autograd/two\_layer\_net\_custom\_function.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/examples_autograd/two_layer_net_custom_function.html)

Hello. I'm Kevin Ko, a machine learning engineer at TUNiB, Korean AI startup. Since last year, GPT3 has taken the lead, and large-scale language models have become mainstream of NLP research. However, from the point of view of a model scientist who has never learned distributed programming, these techniques may still feel very unfamiliar. I was one of them, and I'm still going through a lot of trial and error. 😂

So, I made a tutorial notebooks by organizing various techniques related to large-scale language modeling. I hope this material will be of some help to people like me who are interested in distributed programming and large-scale language models, but are afraid to start. I made all the materials in Korean, my native language, but if you use Google Translate, you will be able to study well. And when I have free time, I will translate all materials into English. Thank you !

[https://blog.google/technology/ai/introducing-pathways-next-generation-ai-architecture/](https://blog.google/technology/ai/introducing-pathways-next-generation-ai-architecture/)

**Summary**

GShard and Switch Transformer are two of the largest machine learning models we’ve ever created, but because both use sparse activation, they [consume less than 1/10th the energy](https://blog.google/technology/ai/minimizing-carbon-footprint/) that you’d expect of similarly sized dense models — while being as accurate as dense models.

So to recap: today’s machine learning models tend to overspecialize at individual tasks when they could excel at many. They rely on one form of input when they could synthesize several. And too often they resort to brute force when deftness and specialization of expertise would do.

That’s why we’re building Pathways. Pathways will enable a single AI system to generalize across thousands or millions of tasks, to understand different types of data, and to do so with remarkable efficiency – advancing us from the era of single-purpose models that merely recognize patterns to one in which more general-purpose intelligent systems reflect a deeper understanding of our world and can adapt to new needs.

**Intro**

Too often, machine learning systems overspecialize at individual tasks, when they could excel at many. That’s why we’re building Pathways—a new AI architecture that will handle many tasks at once, learn new tasks quickly and reflect a better understanding of the world.

When I reflect on the past two decades of computer science research, few things inspire me more than the remarkable progress we’ve seen in the field of artificial intelligence.

In 2001, some colleagues sitting just a few feet away from me at Google realized they could use an obscure technique called machine learning to help correct misspelled Search queries. (I remember I was amazed to see it work on everything from “ayambic pitnamiter” to “unnblevaiabel”). Today, AI augments many of the things that we do, whether that’s helping you [capture a nice selfie](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/06/take-all-your-pictures-to-cleaners-with.html), or providing [more useful search results](https://blog.google/products/search/how-ai-making-information-more-useful/), or warning hundreds of millions of people [when and where flooding will occur](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/09/the-technology-behind-our-recent.html). Twenty years of advances in research have helped elevate AI from a promising idea to an indispensable aid in billions of people’s daily lives. And for all that progress, I’m still excited about its as-yet-untapped potential – AI is poised to help humanity confront some of the toughest challenges we’ve ever faced, from persistent problems like illness and inequality to emerging threats like climate change.

But matching the depth and complexity of those urgent challenges will require new, more capable AI systems – systems that can combine AI’s proven approaches with nascent research directions to be able to solve problems we are unable to solve today. To that end, teams across Google Research are working on elements of a next-generation AI architecture we think will help realize such systems.",1635466654.0,2021-10-29 02:17:34

1. The learning rule produces/organizes most-if-not-all primary visual cortex's non-complex neurons:

https://preview.redd.it/4j39li51m6w71.png?width=661&format=png&auto=webp&s=408f1b8a65a7327072ec8b98761eaad496032cfe

just by interconnecting several thousands of neurons, and flashing natural images to the neurons through ""pixels""/input neurons.

2. The neurons don't distinguish between interconnections and feedforward connections. (e.g. the interconnections are also recurrent connections like biological neurons)

2.1. The learning rule only depends on the neuron's outputs and its inputs, there is no superprocess like backpropagation that leaks the synapses' information; also no cost function or labels anywhere.

3. Likely has machine learning power. A year ago I filmed a cat for 19 seconds with manual camera rotations/zoom-in/zoom-out and I stacked 3 CNN layers with 50 filters/neurons each, showed the network the video for organization stage, and then stacked a single-neuron layer, and made it learn to detect the cat by giving just one point on the cat in a specific frame in the video, and it looks like the neuron somewhat survived the rotation/scale transformations. [The video and the activation map of the cat neuron can be downloaded here.](https://easyupload.io/8l50mu)

4. Converges pretty quickly (about 800-1000 organization steps)

5. The mathematical/theoretical's bottom line is that every behavior of an intelligent object should be backed by as much information/sources as possible. e.g. it's useful for a neuron to depend on many inputs as possible, so when many of its inputs fail, it will continue to function as usual; also this neuron represents real information, because it’s unlikely that many different sources/inputs will tell the same information by chance.

Note that this is trying to be mimic the neurons' learning rule which is dissimilar from what spiking neural networks' trying to mimic in the brain, so the neurons here use RELU, rather than integrate-and-fire etc.",1635422835.0,2021-10-28 14:07:15

We collect a set of image sequences `O_1, O_2, ... O_k`, each one containing the images captured by the robot in that random walk.

Our goal is to transform the dataset of `k` image sequences into a graph, where images are connected by edges if, given the data, it would be possible for the robot to go from one to the other in less than `d` steps. Moreover, edges need to be *directed* since it might be possible to go from image A to image B, but not vice versa (e.g. image A is the image of a glass falling from the table, image B is the glass broken on the floor. Obviously, A->B is an edge but B->A is not).

The requirements are mainly that a) the task is performed by a NN model since it will need to generalize to new image data after training and (possibly) b) the complexity should be at most O(n^(2))

This example in the Keras documentation makes me uncomfortable with how little it mentions generalization and the importance of evaluation.

Many developers take their first steps in ML via Keras (particulary as it's featured in so many GCP courses) so it's important to contextualize the predictions and manage expectations of what one should reasonably expect when minimizing empirical risk and hoping for generalization.

""We use the features to predict whether a patient has a heart disease, [...] The last column, ""target"", indicates whether the patient has a heart disease (1) or not (0).""

No notion of imbalanced data or what it means for a patient to ""have a heart disease"". Are there different kinds? How about levels of severity? Perhaps not super important for an introductory tutorial, but this last statement makes me uncomfortable:

""This particular patient had a 18.8 percent probability of having a heart disease, as evaluated by our model.""

I think this should be wrapped with cautions, else it might lead new learners of Keras into having an overconfidence in what to responsibly expect from a model.

What do you think? Am I overly sensitive here? Something about this being about predicting people's heart disease, where wrong predictions are really bad, makes it especially important, I feel.",1635460938.0,2021-10-29 00:42:18
[D] How do you deal with covariate shift and concept drift in production?,27,qhnao8,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qhnao8/d_how_do_you_deal_with_covariate_shift_and/,36,"To oversimplify, in reality you frequently have covariate shift (or just sample selecion bias) between your test and train set, essentially `P(X)` being changed across time. Aside from this there's the case where there is no covariate shift but `p(y|x)` is altered nonetheless, concept drift. From what I've read the former can be monitored in the upstream data but the latter frequently requires some feedback mechanism that involves ground-truth labelling.

I have a few days off from work per year to dedicate to research and I'm looking to tackle these two problems by implementing something that is 'simple enough'. I've started off by reading a number of survey papers and then digging a bit deeper with some more specific papers.

So far I've been thinking about measuring the distribution of the data upstream, either with process control charts or dividing the data into temporal windows and using KL-divergence to measure covariate shift. I'm especially hopeful of the process control charts as hey may be simple enough for non-data stakeholders to understand. After this I'll consider a retraining / reweighting strategies like ensembles, transfer learning etc.

For the case of concept drift I'll just be looking to continuously provide feedback in terms of ground truth labels and keep track of the performance over time. Potentially plotting the daily/weekly AUC in a process control chart too. After this I'll consider (the same) retraining / reweighting strategies.

Has anyone done anything similar at work? Do you have any recommended readings? If you haven't - do you have any comments on the approach so far?

The core of the idea is that people write functions that look like this:

    def column_c(column_a: pd.Series, column_b: pd.Series) -> pd.Series:
        """"""Some doc string""""""
        return column_a + column_b

instead of:

    df['column_c'] = df['column_a'] + df['column_b']

Yes, I agree, if you're doing small things, then this is probably overkill. However if you are on a team, or have lots (e.g. 100s) of transforms defined over functions then that's where Hamilton really shines; it enables very uniform code (documentation, unit testable), no glue code, low maintenance.

But anyway, back to the question, would this be a paradigm you could see yourself coding in?

[Research] Feeding coordinates (Lat/Long or Projection) into neural network properly,97,qgvkkm,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qgvkkm/research_feeding_coordinates_latlong_or/,75,"hi there,

I'm looking to predict river level change with time using several stations distributed around a big geographical space. I have determined the parameters, however, one of the parameters which proved effective is the location of nearby measurements stations to the observed one. so I want my neural network to be spatially aware of each well location when its training the model.

things I have considered so far:

1. Calculate the Euclidian Distance between each well in relation to the observed well and use that as input (if i have 8 wells, then i would add 7 new variables to the existing parameters which will be inputs to the ANN).
2. Use Hillbert's space-filling curve to convert the 2D coordinates into 1D and feed it to the ANN.

However, so far Option (1) would give inaccurate results for similar distances as its a scaler value not vector. and for Option (2), I have seen people here in the forum say that its not appropriate to use it as its inverse is not continuous and thus inappropriate to use as input.

is what I have summarized so far correct? and is there any other option aside from the above to make the network recognize geographic locations?

your help/feedback would be extremely appreciated as I have been stuck at this issue for a while now.

EDIT: the responses have been extremely helpful and i am immensely grateful to all of you. i wanted to add a few things to the thread as the answers are raising a few issues in my mind.

when i created this thread, my original goal was to find a way to feed the network a map and let it know the locations of the measurement stations in it. and honestly i thought there would be a standard or a widespread way to do so but everyone is doing it in his own way and some more complicated than others and unfortunately with no degree of the effectiveness of each method.

i was speaking to a math friend who suggested to project the Lat/Long into UTM zone and use either Hilbert curve or Fourier transform to convert it into one dimension or frequency domain and feed it to the network, she said she wasn't sure of the solution but it might work so i thought i would add it to the discussion as option (3).",1635337758.0,2021-10-27 14:29:18

These work on a higher level of abstraction and   rather than focusing on transferring colors and textures from one image   to another, they combine the conceptual “style” of one image and the   objective “content” of another in an entirely new image altogether. A   recent paper by Hila Chefer and the team at Tel Aviv University does   just that! The authors propose TargetCLIP, a blending operator that   combines the powerful StyleGAN2 generator with a semantic network CLIP   to achieve a more natural blending than with each model separately. On a   practical level, this idea is implemented with two losses - one that   ensures the output image is similar to the input in the CLIP space, the   other - that the shifts in the CLIP space are linked to shifts in the   StyleGAN space.

[Discussion] Aren't all unserpervised learning tasks basically clustering afterall ?,2,qhj1e1,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qhj1e1/discussion_arent_all_unserpervised_learning_tasks/,7,"If  I think of unsupervised learning, I basically think of clustering but  also anomaly detection, learning the Gaussian mixture of a probability  distribution or learning latent variables in a data distribution....

But fundamentally isn't the purpose of anomaly detection to detect when a data point is outside a given (or learned) cluster ?

Isn't  learning a mixture to regroup the points of high probability density  and regroup them inside a cluster that we condition to be Gaussian.

Isn't learning latent variable of a distribution discovering the implict clusters of your data distribution ?

Isn't all the unsupervised task basically relying on a clustering ?

I  ask those questions to understand unsupervised learning, because (like  many of you I think) I see those unsupervised tasks as the only  philosophical way to reach a global intelligence scheme.

I  would like to see if we cannot extend the limits of clustering (see the  impossibility theorem for example...) to every unsupervised tasks.

My personal opinion here is that it only makes sense for the producer of the models, i.e., the data scientist, to be the one who takes the model to production. Obviously this requires higher abstractions  to accommodate for the skill set gap between a production deployment vs the often script-like experimentation phase in the ML development lifecycle.

[D] Semi-supervised learning with CycleGAN,2,qguvg2,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qguvg2/d_semisupervised_learning_with_cyclegan/,7,"Hey!   
I have been training CycleGAN with medical images for unsupervised image-to-image style transfer. The results are good but not there yet. So, I thought of doing a semi-supervised learning experiment. The images are largely unpaired, but I have got paired (registered) images as well. So, I designed an experiment in which I fed 10% paired & 90% unpaired data for training. Then I tried different percentages of paired data but didn't see much difference in the end result. 

The above observation led me to the conclusion that CycleGAN doesn't have a loss function that helps it directly benefit from the paired data, the cycle consistency loss helps but it's still indirect. There is no direct way to compare the generated images with the ground truth in the case of paired data.

Then I had this crazy idea (disclaimer: it may sound stupid), what if we introduce another L1 loss term for the direct comparison of the generated image with the (in a sense) ground truth. I know for the most part of the training it will confuse the model because of the high percentage of unpaired data (and therefore, it will have a lot smaller weight compared to cycle consistency loss and identity loss). But, can this loss be considered a small noise in the case of unpaired data? And for paired data, it will actually help the model take direct advantage of data alignment.

So, I wanted to ask my fellow machine learning practitioners, especially the seasoned ones, is there any merit to this idea or is it utterly asinine?",1635335399.0,2021-10-27 13:49:59

Few-shot learning addresses this huge demand for datasets by training models to recognize entirely new things from only a few examples. Meta-learning algorithms, in particular, which ‘learn to learn’ utilizing episodic training, can potentially reduce the number of training examples required to train a model. The majority of few-shot learning research, on the other hand, has been driven by benchmark datasets that lack the substantial variability that applications confront when deployed in the real world.

To bridge this gap, Microsoft researchers, in collaboration with the City, University of London, present the ORBIT dataset and few-shot benchmark that helps learn new objects from a small number of high-variation samples. This new benchmark dataset includes a total of 2,687,934 frames, containing 3,822 videos of 486 objects captured on mobile phones by 77 people who are blind or have low vision.

Words are made letters that cannot be understood by AI as is. Thus, word embeddings are tools used to encode a vocabulary of words into a mathematical space which allows deep learning models to ingest textual data. To date, many word embeddings methods exist with various characteristics.

Hence, this paper studies how the various kind and various combinations of these embeddings perform. Additionally, I found that while there exist various kind of embeddings which have been trained differently, combining them does not greatly improve performance. This has a few consequence such as the fact that word embeddings are better compared when used alone instead of alongside others otherwise their difference in performance is overshadowed by the performance already provided by other embeddings in the system.

Let's pretend our goal was to approximate this function with data.

[\`cos\(norm\(x\)\)\` over \`\[-4π, 4π\]\`](https://i.redd.it/9nwp1rueofv71.gif)

To demonstrate how a neural network ""makes a nonlinear function linear"", here I trained a 32 × 8 [multilayer perceptron](https://github.com/tchlux/tchlux.github.io/blob/dfe4c113826bbefca41109b9b0c8697b3e00e9e7/documents/piecewise_linear_regression_model.f90) with [PReLU](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.PReLU.html) activation on the function `cos(norm(x))` with a random uniform 10k points over the `[-4π, 4π]` square. The training was done with 1k steps of full-batch Adam (roughly, [my own version of Adam](https://github.com/tchlux/tchlux.github.io/blob/master/documents/piecewise_linear_regression_model.f90#L664-L696)). Here's the final approximation.

Not perfect, but pretty good! Now here's where things get interesting. What happens if you look at the ""last embedding"" of the network, what does the function look like in that space? Here's a visual where I've taken the representations of the data at that last layer and projected them onto the first two [principal components](https://setosa.io/ev/principal-component-analysis/) with the true function value as the z-axis.

[Last-layer embedding of the 10k training points for the MLP approximating \`cos\(norm\(x\)\)\`](https://i.redd.it/0zt6443kofv71.gif)

Almost perfectly linear! To people that think about what a neural network does a lot, this might be obvious. But I feel like there's a new perspective here that people can benefit from:

# When we train a neural network, we are constructing a function that nonlinearly transforms data into a space where the curvature of the ""target"" is minimized!

In numerical analysis, transformations that you make to data to improve the accuracy of later approximations are called ""preconditioners"". Now preconditioning data for linear approximations has many benefits other than just minimizing the loss of your neural network. [Proven error bounds](https://tchlux.github.io/documents/tchlux-2020-thesis-slides-theorem.pdf) for piecewise linear approximations (many neural networks) are affected heavily by the curvature of the function being approximated (full proof is in [Section 5 of this paper](https://tchlux.github.io/papers/tchlux-2020-NUMA.pdf) for those interested).

&#x200B;

>*What does this mean though?*

It means that after we train a neural network for *any* problem (computer vision, natural language, generic data science, ...) we don't have to use the last layer of the neural network (*ahem*, linear regression) to make predictions. We can use k-nearest neighbor, or a [Shepard interpolant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_distance_weighting), and the accuracy of those methods will usually be improved significantly! Check out what happens for this example when we use k-nearest neighbor to make an approximation.

[Nearest neighbor approximation to \`3x+cos\(8x\)\/2+sin\(5y\)\` over unit cube.](https://i.redd.it/bz4ssu2nofv71.gif)

Now, train a small neural network (8×4 in size) on the \~40 data points seen in the visual, transform the entire space to the last layer embedding of that network (8 dimensions), and visualize the resulting approximation back in our original input space. This is what the new nearest neighbor approximation looks like.

[Nearest neighbor over the same data as before, but after transforming the space with a small trained neural network.](https://i.redd.it/xg5rageoofv71.gif)

[Pretty neat!](https://youtu.be/Hm3JodBR-vs) The maximum error of this nearest neighbor approximation decreased significantly when we used a neural network as a preconditioner. And we can use this concept *anywhere*. Want to make distributional predictions and give statistical bounds for any data science problem? Well that's really easy to do with lots of nearest neighbors! And we have all the tools to do it.

[D] Trouble Modelling High Dimensional Regression Problem with Autoencoder,13,qf4qxs,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qf4qxs/d_trouble_modelling_high_dimensional_regression/,22,"I've been given the task to fit an Autoencoder to a large dataset of 600 dimensional vectors. After constructing some relatively simple AEs (eg., nn.Linear(600) --> nn.Linear(150) --> nn.Linear(5), reverse..), I've found that it's incredibly hard to converge onto a non-trivial solution. These vectors have been normalized in such a way that their means lie \~0.50, and are bounded between 0-1. I have attached an image illustrating a few of the vectors within my dataset.

I'm finding that since these vectors essentially look like noise centered around some global mean value, any model that I attempt to train collapses onto some noisy curve centered around the mean. Importantly, these vectors all represent something important, so smoothing or other preprocessing tricks are out of the question. Sadly, there doesn't seem to be much structure within the data, so a CNN model is also out.

This is basically a high-dimensional regression problem with diverse data. Does anyone have any tips for training an AE model with such data? Is it even possible? Any tips or recommendations would be great!

EDIT:
I realize I was vague. These vectors are the Fourier transform of the original signal, where the first 300 values are the real portion and the second 300 values are the corresponding imaginary (phase) information.

Symbolic knowledge models are usually trained on human-generated corpora that are cumbersome and expensive to create. Such corpora consist of structured triples of symbolic knowledge. This paper takes a different approach and attempts to generate such a corpus by prompting GPT-3. Results show that clever prompting, combined with targeted small critic models trained on human ratings can outperform both human-generated data, as well as the teacher model (GPT-3) itself. The results of this paper give a general recipe for automatically building corpora for various NLP tasks by extracting samples from large language models.

>Mimicking the Brain:  Locality of Reference
In addition to sparsifying the network, our DeepSparse Engine’s breakthrough sparse kernels execute this sparse computation more effectively. The deeply sparsified computation is memory bound, which is unfortunately not good for a CPU. Our solution to this memory boundedness is to execute the neural network depth-wise rather than layer-after-layer. It might seem like magic, but we are able to break the network into Tensor Columns, vertical stripes of computation that fit completely in cache without having to read or write to memory. Tensor Columns mimic the locality of the brain using the locality of reference of the CPUs cache hierarchy: the outputs of the column’s small section of a layer of neurons waits in cache for the next layer as the sparse execution unfolds depth-wise.

Can you make sense of this? How can you execute a model depth-wise rather than layer-after-layer?",1635020456.0,2021-10-23 22:20:56

The ubiquity of high-sampling rate motion sensor chips has presented us with the potential to transform the humble smartphone into a centerpiece of healthcare hardware democratization. Recent literature has shown initial promise in three facets of healthcare: Gait- and posture-related disorders, Geriatric care and Treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. However, these studies have been conducted in a siloed manner with small datasets and oft using low-capacity shallow machine learning models. The goal of this fellowship is to responsibly unite and standardize all of the academic-world's IMU sensor datasets into one open-sourced dataset that is mandated to specifically fuel innovations in the areas of healthcare mentioned above. In doing so, we'd like to celebrate the incredible pioneering efforts of Dr. Jacquelin Perry (1918-2013).",1635030693.0,2021-10-24 01:11:33

Yet, I wonder if by training with both normal and anomalous data some model assumptions might be violated and if using normal data for training is “dirty” trick. At last anomalies 1:1k or 1:10k should influence the gradient",1634950284.0,2021-10-23 02:51:24

[R] Overcome survivorship bias in liver transplant patients,4,qdkt5e,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qdkt5e/r_overcome_survivorship_bias_in_liver_transplant/,3,"Hi, I'm working on my master thesis in the field of ML and AI and I'm stuck with a problem related to [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias).

I have \~2000 patients from the national waiting list for liver transplantation. Every patient has around 30 features (age, gender, pathologies, diagnosis, ...) and my job is to obtain the **transplant benefit: how much the patient life was extended thanks to the transplant**.

Example: given a patient, he was added to the waiting list in 2000. He will die in 2001 if he doesn't receive a transplant. He will die in 2004 if he receives a transplant. This means that the transplant benefit is 36 months or 3 years.

The first step is to build a model to regress how much a patient will survive without receiving a transplant. For example: given model M and patient p_i, I want that M(p_i) = y_i, where y_i is the amount of months p_i survives without getting the transplant.

The problem related to survivorship bias is the following: **patients aren't from the same ""population""** [visualization](https://imgur.com/IZ3tT14):
 - some patients weren't able to receive a transplant (e.g. discarded because incompatible): group A
 - other patients received a transplant and survived some more time: group B

At the moment, I'm forced to train my model M on group A patients because only they haven't received a transplant and they are died because of this. On the contrary group B patients have received a transplant, so cannot be used at this stage.

The issue arises when I want to compute the transplant benefit of transplanted patient p_j:
 1) check when p_j died after the transplant: months_t
 2) use model M to obtain survival without transplant: M(p_j) = months_w
 3) transplant benefit = months_t - months_w

Do you see the issue? M was trained only on group A patients, so it is highly inaccurate when applied to group B patients. It's a survivorship bias problem because the group that I can use for training doesn't represent the entire population but only a subset, that is, only patients discarded and incompatible.

Is there a way to overcome this problem?
It's two days that I'm searching papers and articles on ways to solve this issue, but most of the ""solutions"" propose to use data I have no access to (e.g. train model M on group B patients, but I haven't their death date _without_ transplant!)

**TL;DR**
I have two groups of patients: A and B. Group B has missing labels so I train my model only on group A patients. But this creates huge problems because the different groups have very different populations and characteristics: group B contains patients that survived while group A patients were discarded (survivorship bias).",1634920676.0,2021-10-22 18:37:56

[R] Handling Large Consecutive Missing data for forecasting using LSTM,11,qddelh,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qddelh/r_handling_large_consecutive_missing_data_for/,8,"Hi there. I am trying to use **LSTM for water level forecasting during the monsoon**. I have multiple input water stations and one output water station. I am taking 4 days of data to predict the output station's water level the next day. I have a dataset from 1960 to 2013. The problem with my dataset is that it contains many missing values. Most of the **data are missing during the non-monsoon months**. Also, data is missing from 2003 to 2005 and in other places, many months too. I have imputed the data using python libraries, but the results are not good as the **gap is too large**.

Imputing such data is creating too much noise. As my focus is primarily on monsoon data, **can I discard the non-monsoon months?**

Another thing I wanted to know is that is it okay to perform **Litwise Deletion** on a dataset that will be used to train a neural network model for forecasting? Especially when I take a length of input data(like consecutive days of data as input)?

Personally, as my primary goal is to make water level predictions in monsoon time, I want to discard the non-monsoon months and remove any missing data by Litwise deletion. I did perform the forecasting prediction by discarding the non-monsoon months, and I got **better results** than imputing the whole dataset(for monsoon and non-monsoon months).",1634895938.0,2021-10-22 11:45:38

Traditional clustering algos don't work for categorical attributes/columns and I don't want to drop such attributes. The complete code and the dataset can be referred [here](https://github.com/arjun-majumdar/machine-learning-musing/blob/master/Mixed_Dataset_Clustering_Example.ipynb).

*Gower's distance* creates a square matrix of dimensions: m x m where 'm'  is the number of rows in the dataset. For the Adult dataset,  it's shape is (32561, 15). So, gower's distance creates a square matrix of  shape (32561, 32561). Assuming each number takes 32-bit floating point  precision, this matrix takes up roughly 4 GB of RAM.

To hyper-parameter tune DBSCAN algo, DMDBSCAN method is used. On using the *NearestNeighbors* algorithm on this matrix-

    neighbors = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors = 28)
    nbrs = neighbors.fit(loaded_gower_dist) 

crashes the Kernel in Google Colab environment which has around 12 GB of RAM. Any way to avoid this? Also, this shows that Gower's distance doesn't scale well as the dataset size grows.

**Abstract**

The intersection between neuroscience and artificial intelligence (AI) research has created synergistic effects in both fields. While neuroscientific discoveries have inspired the development of AI architectures, new ideas and algorithms from AI research have produced new ways to study brain mechanisms. A well-known example is the case of reinforcement learning (RL), which has stimulated neuroscience research on how animals learn to adjust their behavior to maximize reward. In this review article, we cover recent collaborative work between the two fields in the context of meta-learning and its extension to social cognition and consciousness. Meta-learning refers to the ability to learn how to learn, such as learning to adjust hyperparameters of existing learning algorithms and how to use existing models and knowledge to efficiently solve new tasks. This meta-learning capability is important for making existing AI systems more adaptive and flexible to efficiently solve new tasks. Since this is one of the areas where there is a gap between human performance and current AI systems, successful collaboration should produce new ideas and progress. Starting from the role of RL algorithms in driving neuroscience, we discuss recent developments in deep RL applied to modeling prefrontal cortex functions. Even from a broader perspective, we discuss the similarities and differences between social cognition and meta-learning, and finally conclude with speculations on the potential links between intelligence as endowed by model-based RL and consciousness. For future work we highlight data efficiency, autonomy and intrinsic motivation as key research areas for advancing both fields.

Researchers at Huawei and Shanghai Jiao Tong University have developed [CIPS-3D](https://github.com/PeterouZh/CIPS-3D), an approach that synthesizes each pixel value independently, just as its 2D version did.

The proposed generator consists of a shallow 3D NeRF network simplified to alleviate memory complexity and has the capacity for deep 2D INR (implicit neural representation) networks without any spatial convolution or up-sampling operations. The proposed generator’s design is consistent with the well-known semantic hierarchical principle of GANs, where early layers ((i.e., the shallow NeRF network in the generator) determine pose and middle/high ((i.e., the INR network in the generator) control color scheme. The early NeRF network enables the research team to control camera pose explicitly easily.

In: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcgydm9dlYg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcgydm9dlYg)

You need to see the first two presentations to understand what I'm trying to comunicate here.

I’ll try to be very concise. In short my statement is that with similarities and substitutions you can have solutions of previously unsolved problems. In other words, generate new knowledge using previous related knowledge.

I apologize in advance for my lack of proper technical terms. But, if the idea get through, that will be enough for me. I hope my explanation is understandable.

The following is a graph composed by sub-graphs, the nodes are linked by the equal ‘=’ relation, which goes in both directions in case there is no more links, by default is left to right. The nodes can be single values or sets.

For briefness and explain-ability I will use this notation instead of an actual graph (image).

About my notations: 

* \[v1, v2\] is a set,
* '=' is the relation,
* Every line can be seen as a sub-graph.
* I will use // to add a comment for explanation
* A ‘query’ is a new node that has no similarity relation in the graph and therefore the algorithm needs to be used

**The initial state of the graph and a case of a query and the result:**

    [Medical, report, system] = [request, R1] 
    // given that [unsolved, request] = [new, request]
    [request, R1] = [unsolved, request] 
    [request, R1] = [request, name] // given that R1 = name
    [request, R1] = request
    [request, R1] = [resolve, request] // given that: [unsolved,request]=[request,R1]
    [resolve, [request, R1]] = work // given that: request = [request, R1]
    // here [solution, R1] can be generated by a stored procedure for simplicity, 
    // and in this case is used to
    // identify the node that will be the actual solution
    // given that: work = [resolve, request], and work = [solution, for, request]
    [solution, for, [request, R1]] = [solution, R1]

    // For the next part, to do a new query I will do the following to avoid ambiguity
    // this can be resolve in multiple ways, in this case I’ll go with this
    [request, R1] != [new, request] 

**At this point I will do a new query to illustrate how with substitutions we can generate a new knowledge, given the previous state of graph.**

    [request, R2] is not similar enough to [solution, R1] because:
    // If we take into account the full sequence of substitutions we will notice 
    // that [Hotel,management,system] is not equal to [Medical,report,system]
    // We can do better, if we use 'solution' instead of [solution, R1]:
    
    [solution, R1] = solution
    [request, R2] = solution // given the previous relation
    [request, R2] = [
        [[available, engineer], [engineer, job]],

    [request, R2] = [
        [Bob, [model, system]], 
        [Alice, [develop, system]], 
        [Mary, [design, UI]]
    ]
    // final output
    [solution, R2] = [
        [Bob, [model, system]], 
        [Alice, [develop, system]], 
        [Mary, [design, UI]]
    ]

This example is not really that interesting, and looking at the result it seems pretty obvious. But the key here is that is generalizable, and is just substitutions.

This substitution mechanism can be applied to multiple cases to solve any kind of situations, given that it has enough previous knowledge. Is like applying a formula, step by step.

We invite everyone to the online research colloquium by Max Welling from the University of Amsterdam. Participation is free.

**When:** 26 October, 16:20 (GMT+3 / Moscow time)

**Title**: Is the next deep learning disruption in the physical sciences?

**Join:** [https://cs.hse.ru/en/announcements/516500821.html](https://cs.hse.ru/en/announcements/516500821.html) 

**Abstract:** 

A number of fields, most prominently speech, vision and NLP have been disrupted by deep learning technology. A natural question is: ""which application areas will follow next?"". My prediction is that the physical sciences will experience an unprecedented acceleration by combining the tools of simulation on HPC clusters with the tools of deep learning to improve and accelerate this process. Together, they form a virtuous cycle where simulations create data that feeds into deep learning models which in turn improves the simulations. In a way, this is like building a self-learning computational microscope for the physical sciences. In this talk I will illustrate this using two recent pieces of work from my lab: molecular simulation and PDE solving. In molecular simulation we try to predict molecular properties or digitally synthesize molecules with prescribed properties. We have built a number of equivariant graph neural networks to achieve this. Partial differential equations (PDEs) are the most used mathematical model in natural sciences to describe physical processes. Intriguingly, we find that PDE solvers can be learned from data using graph neural networks as well, which has the added benefit that we can learn a solver that can generalize across PDEs and different boundary conditions. Moreover, it may open the door to ab initio learning of PDEs directly from data.

Hello,

My background is in material science. I am using neural networks to predict various material and physical properties (density, stiffness, toughness, strength, etc.)

I first built a single neural network taking 6 inputs and predicting 12 outputs (material properties). The performance was quite high for some properties but very poor for others. (based on R2 scores)

I decided to split the network into multiple ""specialized networks"", taking in the same inputs as the previous model, but only outputting 2 or 3 properties at maximum. I was happily surprised to see that the performance of the neural networks was now high for almost all properties.

I understand that mathematically, we are not solving the same problem, but does anyone have some insights on why can't a single model make highly accurate predictions for all properties?

Is it possible but would necessitate more careful tuning of hyperparameters, or are specialized networks always superior?

Thank you. Looking forward to your inputs.",1634846003.0,2021-10-21 21:53:23

Abstract: ""This book is a graduate-level introduction to probabilistic programming. It not only provides a thorough background for anyone wishing to use a probabilistic programming system, but also introduces the techniques needed to design and build these systems. It is aimed at people who have an undergraduate-level understanding of either or, ideally, both probabilistic machine learning and programming languages.
We start with a discussion of model-based reasoning and explain why conditioning is a foundational computation central to the fields of probabilistic machine learning and artificial intelligence. We then introduce a first-order probabilistic programming language (PPL) whose programs correspond to graphical models with a known, finite, set of random variables. In the context of this PPL we introduce fundamental inference algorithms and describe how they can be implemented.
We then turn to higher-order probabilistic programming languages. Programs in such languages can define models with dynamic computation graphs, which may not instantiate the same set of random variables in each execution. Inference requires methods that generate samples by repeatedly evaluating the program. Foundational algorithms for this kind of language are discussed in the context of an interface between program executions and an inference controller.
Finally we consider the intersection of probabilistic and differentiable programming. We begin with a discussion of automatic differentiation, and how it can be used to implement efficient inference methods based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. We then discuss gradient-based maximum likelihood estimation in programs that are parameterized using neural networks, how to amortize inference using by learning neural approximations to the program posterior, and how language features impact the design of deep probabilistic programming systems.""

""A key design element of Swin Transformer is its shift of the window partition between consecutive self-attention layers, as illustrated in Figure 2. The shifted windows bridge the windows of the preceding layer, providing connections among them that significantly enhance modeling power. This strategy is also efficient in regards to real-world latency: all query patches within a window share the same key set1, which facilitates memory access in hardware. In contrast, earlier sliding window based self-attention approaches \[33, 50\] suffer from low latency on general hardware due to different key sets for different query pixels. Our experiments show that the proposed shifted window approach has much lower latency than the sliding window method, yet is similar in modeling power. The shifted window approach also proves beneficial for all-MLP architectures.""

[D] Boring machine learning is where it's at,5,qbyhlz,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qbyhlz/d_boring_machine_learning_is_where_its_at/,17,"*Note: This is a short opinion piece I wrote, which I thought might be relevant to post here given all the ""career"" talk that's been going on, I'd be rather curious to hear if people here think this is a valid perspective, or if I'm glancing over some important stuff.*

It surprises me that when people think of ""software that brings about the singularity"" they think of text models, or of RL agents. But they sneer at decision tree boosting and the like as boring algorithms for boring problems.

To me, this seems counter-intuitive, and the fact that most people researching ML are interested in subjects like vision and language is flabergasting. For one, because getting anywhere productive in these fields is really hard, for another, because their usefulness seems relatively minimal.

I've said it before and I'll say it again, human brains are very good at the stuff they've been doing for a long time. This ranges from things like controlling a human-like body to things like writing prose and poetry. Seneca was as good of a philosophy writer as any modern, Shakespear as good of a playwright as any contemporary. That is not to say that new works and diversity in literature isn't useful, both from the perspective of diversity and of updating to language and zeitgeist, but it's not game-changing.

Human brains are shit at certain tasks, things like finding the strongest correlation with some variables in an n-million times n-million valued matrix. Or heck, even finding the most productive categories to quantify a spreadsheet with a few dozen categorical columns and a few thousand rows. That's not to mention things like optimizing 3d structures under complex constraints or figuring out probabilistic periodicity in a multi-dimensional timeseries.

The later sort of problem is where machine learning has found the most amount of practical usage, problems that look ""silly"" to a researcher but implacable to a human mind. On the contrary, 10 years in, computer vision is still struggling to find any meaningfully large market fits outside of self-driving. There are a few interesting applications, but they have limited impact and a low market cap. The most interesting applications, related to bioimaging, happen to be things people are quite bad at; They are very divergent from the objective of creating human-like vision capabilities, since the results you want are anything but human-like.

Even worst, there's the problem that human-like ""AI"" will be redundant the moment it's implemented. Self-driving cars are a real challenge precisely until the point when they become viable enough that everybody uses them, afterwards, every car is running on software and we can replace all the fancy CV-based decision making with simple control structures that rely on very constrained and ""sane"" behaviour from all other cars. Google assistant being able to call a restaurant or hospital and make a booking for you, or act as the receptionist taking that call, is relevant right until everyone starts using it, afterwards everything will already be digitized and we can switch to better and much simpler booking APIs.

That's not to say *all* human-like ""AI"" will be made redundant, but we can say that its applications are mainly well-known and will diminish over time, giving way to simpler automation as people start being replaced with algorithms. I say its applications are ""well known"" because they boil down to ""the stuff that humans can do right now which is boring or hard enough that we'd like to stop doing it"". There's a huge market for this, but it's huge in the same way as the whale oil market was in the 18th century. It's a market without that much growth potential.

On the other hand, the applications of ""inhuman"" algorithms are boundless, or at least only bounded by imagination. I've argued before that science hasn't yet caught up to the last 40 years of machine learning. People prefer designing equations by hand and validating them with arcane (and easy to fake, misinterpret and misuse) statistics, rather than using algorithmically generate solutions and validating them with simple, rock-solid methods such as CV. People like Horvath are hailed as genius-level polymaths in molecular biology for calling 4 scikit-learn functions on a tiny dataset.

*Note: Horvath's work is great and I in no way want to pick on him specifically, the world would be much worse without him, I hope epigenetic clocks predict he'll live and work well into old age. I don't think he personally ever claimed the ML side of his work is in any way special or impressive, this is just what I've heard other biologists say.*

This is not to say that the scientific establishment is doomed or anything, it's just slow at using new technologies, especially those that shift the onus of what a researcher ought to be doing. The same goes for industry; A lot of high-paying, high-status positions involve doing work algorithms are better at, precisely because it's extremely difficult for people, and thus you need the smartest people for it.

However, market forces and common sense are at work, and there's a constant uptick in usage. While I don't believe this can bring about a singularity so to speak, it will accelerate research and will open up new paradigms (mainly around data gathering and storage) and new problems that will allow ML to take centre stage.

So in that sense, it seems obvious to postulate a limited and decreasing market for human-like intelligence and a boundless and increasing market for ""inhuman"" intelligence.

This is mainly why I like to focus my work on the latter, even if it's often less flashy and more boring. One entirely avoidable issue with this is that the bar of doing better than a person is low, and the state of benchmarking is so poor as to make head-to-head competition between techniques difficult. Though this in itself is the problem I'm aiming to help solve.

That's about it, so I say go grab a spreadsheet and figure out how to get the best result on a boring economics problem with a boring algorithm; Don't worry so much about making a painting or movie with GANs, we're already really good at doing that and enjoy doing it.",1634728658.0,2021-10-20 13:17:38

**Abstract**

Understanding information processing in the brain—and creating general-purpose artificial intelligence—are long-standing aspirations of scientists and engineers worldwide. The distinctive features of human intelligence are high-level cognition and control in various interactions with the world including the self, which are not defined in advance and are vary over time. The challenge of building human-like intelligent machines, as well as progress in brain science and behavioural analyses, robotics, and their associated theoretical formalisations, speaks to the importance of the world-model learning and inference. In this article, after briefly surveying the history and challenges of internal model learning and probabilistic learning, we introduce the free energy principle, which provides a useful framework within which to consider neuronal computation and probabilistic world models. Next, we showcase examples of human behaviour and cognition explained under that principle. We then describe symbol emergence in the context of probabilistic modelling, as a topic at the frontiers of cognitive robotics. Lastly, we review recent progress in creating human-like intelligence by using novel probabilistic programming languages. The striking consensus that emerges from these studies is that probabilistic descriptions of learning and inference are powerful and effective ways to create human-like artificial intelligent machines and to understand intelligence in the context of how humans interact with their world.",1634695896.0,2021-10-20 04:11:36

"[R] Facebook AI Introduce ‘SaLinA’: A Lightweight Library To Implement Sequential Decision Models, Including Reinforcement Learning Algorithms (Paper, Github link included)",18,qb137c,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qb137c/r_facebook_ai_introduce_salina_a_lightweight/,1,"Deep Learning libraries are great for facilitating the implementation of complex differentiable functions. These functions typically have shapes like f(x) → y, where x is a set of input tensors, and y is output tensors produced by executing multiple computations over those inputs. In order to implement a new f function and create a new prototype, one will need to assemble various blocks (or modules) through composition operators. Despite of the easy process, this approach cannot handle the implementation of sequential decision methods. Classical platforms are well-suited for managing the acquisition, processing, and transformation of information in an efficient way.

When it comes to reinforcement learning (RL), these all implementations get critical. A classical deep-learning framework is not enough to capture the interaction of an agent with their environment. Still, extra code can be written that does not integrate well into these platforms. It has been considered to use multiple reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks for these tasks, but they still have two drawbacks:

* New abstractions are being created all the time in order to model more complex systems. However, these new ideas often have a high adoption cost and low flexibility, making them difficult for laypersons who may not be familiar with reinforcement learning techniques.
* The use cases for RL are as vast and varied as the problems it solves. For that reason, there is no one-size-fits all library available on these platforms because each platform has been designed to solve a specific type of problem with their unique features from model-based algorithms through batch processing or multiagent playback strategies, among other things – but they can’t do everything.

As a solution to the above two problems, Facebook researchers introduce [‘SaLinA’](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07910.pdf). SaLina works towards making the implementation of sequential decision processes, including reinforcement learning related, natural and simple for practitioners with a basic understanding of how neural networks can be implemented. SaLina proposes to solve any sequential decision problem by using simple ‘agents’ that process information sequentially. The targeted audience are not only RL researchers or computer vision researchers, but also NLP experts looking for a natural way of modelling conversations in their models, making them more intuitive and easy to understand than previous methods.

[D] Pretraining/transfer learning with SageMaker BlazingText (word2vec)?,0,qbeyas,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qbeyas/d_pretrainingtransfer_learning_with_sagemaker/,2,"I have a training set consisting of a description and a binary label. From reading previous work, I know that using pretrained [fasttext embeddings](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html) should work well for my use case. I need to be able to make predictions on unseen words (OOV). My company is already using aws/sagemaker, so using [SageMaker Blazing text with subword embedding](https://github.com/aws/amazon-sagemaker-examples/blob/master/introduction_to_amazon_algorithms/blazingtext_word2vec_subwords_text8/blazingtext_word2vec_subwords_text8.ipynb) seems like a good approach.

However, they are providing their own training data in the example - does this means it tries to learn word embeddings from scratch from only this training data? I was expecting to be able to pass pretraining as a parameter, and then fine tune it with my own data so those words get added to the known dictionary.

But the way it looks to me now, is that I either use a lookup against a hardcoded list of pretrained embeddings (like GloVe or one of the word vector datasets from fasttext), which means I'm not using my own data and also have to come up with a solution to handling OOV. Or I use Blazing text which can handle OOV, but then I don't take advantage of any pretrained model?

So my main question is this: can I use Blazing text to get pretrained OOV embeddings? And if so how?

Would be great if I could also understand how transfer learning would work in this case, so I can make use of my own classification data. However, the embeddings will be used in a downstream classification task, so I guess I could say the fine tuning happens there?

* Use pretrined blazing text model to get embeddings for both seen and unseen words (through subword embeddings)
* Combine these embeddings with other features
* Fit a model around the embeddings + features to get the classification

Comparing two neural networks can be a daunting task. Just comparing their performance isn’t always the best way. By comparing their internal representations / learned features, a lot more insight can be obtained. 

I wrote a quick library to compare the features of PyTorch models by their similarity. This is done through the metric - Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA). CKA is based on HSIC (Hilber-Schmidt Independence Criterion) for detecting non-linear dependencies with scalability. [Reference.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15327)

Compared to other similarity metrics, CKA is scalable as you can use a minibatched version over the entire dataset ( I could even run on the whole ImageNet testset). The size of networks that can be compared depends on your memory but you can always select specific features of your interest.

CKA can compare quite different architectures like CNNs and ViTs. This can also be used for ablation studies where the internal representations are studied rather than just final performance (which comes with its own statistical significance issues).

[R] Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Structural and Positional Representations,63,qai1i7,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qai1i7/r_graph_neural_networks_with_learnable_structural/,8,"Hi all,

Presenting a general framework for Graph Neural Networks to learn positional encodings (PE) alongside structural representations, applicable to any MP-GNNs, including (Graph) Transformers.  


""**Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Structural and Positional Representations**""  
Vijay Prakash Dwivedi, Anh Tuan Luu, Thomas Laurent, Yoshua Bengio and Xavier Bresson.  


Paper: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07875](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.07875.pdf)  
Code: [https://github.com/vijaydwivedi75/gnn-lspe](https://github.com/vijaydwivedi75/gnn-lspe)   


**#2minutebrief**  
Nodes in a graph do not have canonical positional information, like the global word positions in a sentence. This gives rise to limitations such as the lack of (global) structural information when message-passing GNNs are applied to learn on graphs. As a result, such models cannot distinguish isomorphic nodes or other graph symmetries.

In this work, we consider this problem of graph PEs and propose a framework named LSPE that can be used with any MP-GNNs to learn positional and structural feature representations at the same time, thus effectively capturing the two essential properties and tuning these w.r.t. to the task at hand.  


[Fig. The general MPGNNs-LSPE architecture.](https://preview.redd.it/b6421c00z5u71.png?width=1335&format=png&auto=webp&s=f28a693b4512eb0392c186c758afd189d7ab84e8)

In brief, LSPE enhances capabilities of an MP-GNN in the following way:  
1. At the input layer, PEs are initialized with k-dimensional Random Walk that encodes the landing probabilities of a node to itself in 1 to k steps. This leads to unique node representations (at the input itself) for nodes which have unique k-hop neighborhoods in the graph.  
2. At the GNN layers, both the structural and positional representations are updated with separate learnable parameters but following the same analytical update function of a GNN instance chosen.  
3. At the final layer, the learned structural and positional representations are fused to output the resultant node features which is then used for the learning task being dealt with. In addition, a positional loss is used to tune the final layer positional features.  


Above simple steps improves several MP-GNNs and Transformer-GNNs providing a performance boost of up to 64% on molecular datasets. At the same time, we retain the efficient linear complexity of message-passing while generating more expressive node embedding.

[P] Open-Source Synthetic Data Generation Library,19,qan38i,MachineLearning,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/qan38i/p_opensource_synthetic_data_generation_library/,6,"Hi r/MachineLearning community! We are the guys from YData and some time ago we have created an open-source project exclusively for synthetic data ( [https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic) ). Hopefully, this will be useful for you!

The purpose of the library is to help you creating synthetic data. It could be used when the original data is not enough or when you don't want any identifiable information to ensure individual's privacy. As it is open-sourced, it's always nice if you guys want to contribute or give some feedback :)

Some tutorial notebooks to get started with the library: [https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic/tree/master/examples/regular](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic/tree/master/examples/regular)

If you've got any ideas or you want to discuss the implementations, feel free to hangout in our friendly synthetic data slack community at [https://slack.ydata.ai](https://slack.ydata.ai/) !",1634565048.0,2021-10-18 15:50:48

Wanted to share a Colab notebook that I thought folks here might appreciate. It allows you to log and visualize [StyleGAN3](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3) training runs (images, videos, metrics, hyperparams)—using Comet for the logging/visualization

Full disclaimer, I work at Comet as their Head of Community, and to log your own training runs, you do need a free Comet account. But you can run the notebook without the logging as well, and we thought something like this might be of use to folks who are currently experimenting with the new StyleGAN3 architecture.

Here's the link to the notebook if it's of any interest: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1\_Mk\_pP8H9lkLLvAs\_ae8X4ji8N253caC#scrollTo=HEaeYEdWiKPY](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_Mk_pP8H9lkLLvAs_ae8X4ji8N253caC#scrollTo=HEaeYEdWiKPY)

Summary:

>End-to-end encoder for visual retrieval that uses only self-attention blocks. This allows flexible training of millions of variable length videos and images jointly.

Abstract:

>Our objective in this work is video-text retrieval - in particular a joint embedding that enables efficient text-to-video retrieval. The challenges in this area include the design of the visual architecture and the nature of the training data, in that the available large scale video-text training datasets, such as HowTo100M, are noisy and hence competitive performance is achieved only at scale through large amounts of compute. We address both these challenges in this paper.We propose an end-to-end trainable model that is designed to take advantage of both large-scale image and video captioning datasets. Our model is an adaptation and extension of the recent ViT and Timesformer architectures, and consists of attention in both space and time. The model is flexible and can be trained on both image and video text datasets, either independently or in conjunction. It is trained with a curriculum learning schedule that begins by treating images as 'frozen' snapshots of video, and then gradually learns to attend to increasing temporal context when trained on video datasets. We also provide a new video-text pretraining dataset WebVid-2M, comprised of over two million videos with weak captions scraped from the internet. Despite training on datasets that are an order of magnitude smaller, we show that this approach yields state-of-the-art results on standard downstream video-retrieval benchmarks including MSR-VTT, MSVD, DiDeMo and LSMDC.",1634552848.0,2021-10-18 12:27:28
